  - - My New Year's resolution
    - 110
    - ''
    - "Today's post is in English, as cases of people not speaking English at all
      are as rare as interesting moments at school. The point is that on Monday, 3rd
      Jan., that is the first Monday of the year, I was late for English. My teacher
      came to me, while I was discussing New Year's celebrations with my schoolmate,
      Marta, and ordered me to write an essay of 250 words. The result goes below.\r\n<em>\r\n<h6>My
      New Year's Resolution - be on time in English lesson and how to achieve it</h6>\r\nA
      common European custom is making New Year's resolutions. Most of these are plans
      of losing a few pounds or quitting smoking. My English teacher suggested that
      my only resolution could be not being late for English lessons every time, as
      I don't smoke, nor am I overweight. I'm not sure if I agree with that as there
      are many subjects of making resolutions way more interesting than those English
      lessons at five to nine early in the morning - I don't even know if there is
      a single being in our galaxy willing to attend such lessons, but OK - I might
      try.\r\n\r\nIn order to achieve the goal of not being late, one needs:\r\n<ul><li>a
      working alarm clock loud enough to wake them up (a few hours before sunrise),</li><li>three
      cubic meters of hot, „pickaxe-strong” coffee to bring them back to the awful
      reality, full of routine, wars and insecurities,</li><li>and an ability to leave
      home 30 minutes before the lesson starts, which is almost impossible if one
      has such urgent needs as drinking the last cup of delicious jasmine tea or packing
      the survival kit (mostly books.)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nThe real problem with me is
      not that I can't get up early enough, but that everythings seems so important.
      Then I realize it's 8.40 and I still need to moisten my throat with some tap
      water, than it's just too late and I can't help it anymore. Dear teacher! It
      looks like I'll never be able to come on time again.\r\n</em>\r\n<h6>Asskicking
      party</h6>\r\nSo, I just came home from 18th birthday party of my colleague
      from the music school, Marlena. The party was completely awesome, including
      large-breasted girls (or maybe just one), free alcohol and wild dances with
      all the women present. Fellow brass players advised me to practise more, so
      as to become a good player. Finally, it looks like my ability to write any meaningful
      text in foreign languages at 2 am can be affected by drinking beer accompanied
      by French fries, Greek fish, Polish hamburgers and some weird wines.\r\n\r\nI
      still think a lot about my weight-height ratio. I tried to run a few laps around
      the place undisturbed by the sounds of traffic, but I eventually run into some
      friend and everything got screwed up. I still think a lot about everything I
      could do better in the past or that I could do better in the future, but obviously
      I won't. I wonder if printing a few more sheets of lousy elephant business cards
      could help me prevent further development of melancholy. The only thing I know
      for sure is that my English sucks and I'm not going to use it in the blog for
      quite a moment. Maybe my next project could be an internationalized blog just
      in English? I'm not sure if it makes any sense, knowing that almost no one read
      any of the texts in Esperanto. Hopefully there are more people able to understand
      my terrible English than just the one, which in fact may be the same lonely
      person that had ever read any of the texts in Esperanto. The website could be
      named „Poor but Awesome”, or rather something way more corresponding to the
      real reality, like „Memories of an Elephant” or „Memories of the only person
      in galaxy who has elephant in their business cards”. Also the content management
      system I would code from scratch using Ruby on Rails and NetBeans, which I think
      are almost as awesome as the 1m girls. Together they could act as a software
      version of Mountainpunch and Oakextracter, famous characters from Slavic mythology;
      still, I'm not sure, which one could act as which of those.\r\n\r\n"

    - "Nothing's different, either. At least the weather's nice. It was 8 &deg;C in
      the morning, while I was lazily walking back to school after a weekend. The
      Elephant is back! Some minutes past nine and I am in front of the classroom
      door, corridors empty, no one is home. Enter the Elephant! A few loud steps
      and sound of funfairs. I was wondering how to greet my fellow classmates in
      an unusual way. My face was showing a horrible grin of both joy and space, due
      to getting quite a lot of sleep, green tea and drugs, some mandalas offered
      at the weekend, and a few more joyful circumstances. Meanwhile, royal elephant
      helpers blocked my way, and I heard:\r\n'The Tiiimeee&hellip; is OVER,' said
      mistress Teacher. 'Goodbye.'\r\n\r\nIt took me a moment to regain consciousness
      outside the classroom. A quick look at the phone's display told me that there
      was still a lot of time and space for joyous activities, such as walking outdoors.
      Thus I was punished for being late by being allowed to go out. That sounds nice
      and logical. I wonder why there still are people who think I would regret my
      acts of laziness if they gave me a huge banknote and told me to go get myself
      some drugs and rethink my life somewhere else. How the heck can I regret being
      late, if we get a few moments of October in the middle of January? Sometimes
      fighting the system is just nice.\r\n\r\nWhat's neither the same anymore, nor
      any different, is that the girls never even bother to look in my direction,
      at least not the nice ones. If I memorized all the spells from the spellbook
      that I've inherited from uncle Merlin, or induced some of the miracles that
      could lead Guru Rinpoche to pure envy, I'm sure they wouldn't even notice.\r\nI
      wonder why there are some people that are weird and are of an elephant's shape
      to a degree even greater than mine, which are certainly not handsome or tall,
      but still have effect on chicks like fly paper on flies.\r\n\r\n"

    - "Today, or, since a few minutes ago - yesterday, was Friday. I don't know what
      the others may think about that, but for me Friday used to be one of the words
      to express freedom. Democracy or equal rights might be great and brave, but,
      especially when looking at their implementation in the USA, seem to fade out
      besides such a brilliant time as Friday, when there's nothing that you really
      have to do, and you can just meet your friends and talk about your plans for
      the future, either as distant as the 60s or as close as following evening. While
      Monday is the day of complaining about getting up at a time one had rather go
      to sleep if not the duties of the youth, then remembering the parties one has
      been to, I get more and more surprised by the power of dreams and wishes we
      often discuss on Fridays. If that's not freedom, then what it is?\r\n\r\nI went
      to a party at Radek's, with a quick stop at a shop in the city centre. I thought
      I would manage to buy myself a beer with my ID card, if at least the year of
      birth fits the stereotype of an eighteen-years-old, but no! The shop assistant
      didn't even ask. Just a moment later I bumped into a friend from the kindergarten,
      who obviously was the first person that had ever read the first post on good
      old Ubogo, Ale Chędogo, back in 2008.\r\n\r\nThen there was a party. Well, not
      strictly a party, but rather an evening by a shared table. We have drunk and
      talked about the past. One of us told a story of his past girlfriend that lived
      in some awesomely distant place, where he couldn't even sleep because of birds
      singing all day long from 5 in the morning, which seems really terrible. Her
      house used to be a manor, then turned into a school, which was then sold to
      one of the teachers, or something similar. Her room was once a classroom, so
      it must have been really big. I especially liked the part when he went back
      home to Koszalin on foot, 32 kilometers in one piece, so as not to be impolite
      staying overnight at hers. I like long walks just as much as I like riding my
      bike all day long or cooking. The more I think of them, the more I associate
      it with freedom of travelling, a tent by the road, hitch-hiking and traversing
      foreign galaxies in order to rescue one's beloved from slimy arms of some dirty
      pervert with three heads and one green eye. Then come mental images of fresh
      tomatoes, peppers, watermelons and cherries, and all these things that are only
      available in the summer.\r\n\r\nI guess that there is a bunch of nice girls
      I could share my meals with, especially one in the mat-inf-fiz. Unfortunately,
      none of them seems to care about my will of being generous on the level of food,
      in fact, I don't even know any of them in person. I don't know if there is a
      feeling more pathetic than the one when a girl of my daydreams passes by several
      times a day, but some mental database lock denies me access to my speech centre.
      Of course, I could still shout some undefined sounds (if the sound of 0 is silence,
      then what is the sound of '''nil'''?) or one of lovely Chinese onomatopeias
      (哎呀！ 喂！ 嘿！ 嗯！), but I guess they would sound weird in the ears of a person with
      not much interest in East Asian languages, and eventually lead to a look of
      disgust and render the shouter incompatible with the girl's vision of a potential
      eating partner. And even if there were a girl crazy about such multilingual
      elephants eating oatmeal, and even if I met her in person, something would certainly
      go wrong. She could do spelling mistakes, for example omit a comma or interrobang
      (‽), which bespeaks a high level of linguistic ignorance and an apparent hatred
      for one's mother tongue.\r\nOh, yeah, one has a lot of problems, if he can't
      even announce his presence to a girl constantly passing by in the same manner
      since October.\r\n"

    - "'''Excercise. Write a story, in which a sudden occurence during a plane flight
      causes your delay and you have problems because of that.'''\r\n\r\nThe attempt
      to write the excercise is caused by my profound will to fight the system, or,
      to be honest and more precise, to fight the school - the way you befriend a
      foe to stab them in their back with a convenient pocket dagger (which I always
      carry by my side), after you have drunk vodka together for their money, while
      the foe is sleeping. This is the same movement that caused me to read ''Potop''
      when we had to read ''Tartuffe'', and that makes me read ''Forefather's Eve'',
      which we have already finished a few months ago. Therefore is the story toxic
      to the senses and lethal to the soul. Keep that in mind and beware!\r\n\r\n<h3>Crossing
      the border</h3>\r\nA few years ago me and my brother Steve were flying home
      from Sydney. The journey was quite pleasant and interesting. I was sitting by
      the window and admiring clouds, sliding down there, a few thousand feet above
      the ground. I tried to listen to music, but it sounded weird, then I tried to
      read, but the letters were jumping in my eyes, so I couldn't catch their sense.\r\nThen
      I realized those were the symptoms I had heard so much of before: we were crossing
      the Transcendental Border of Multi-Dimensionsional Eternity. Steve and I looked
      at each other meaningfully and I saw a quiet, non-verbal oh-yeah in his eyes.
      And then it happened.\r\n\r\nA mild, pleasant thrill at first, then I felt as
      if hit with nothingness - it can't hurt, but hurts yet more. Immediately, my
      consciousness emerged from three-dimensional sensory percepcion of space to
      six-dimensional, then to the seventh, ultimate level, where nothing more can
      occur.\r\nDo you know what a parallel universe is? Some theories say that each
      time there is a possibility of any choice, even the smallest, there appears
      a separate universe for both options. Let's try to count them. If our universe
      emerged after what we call a Big Bang and will probably end in a similar way
      by what scientists call a Big Collapse, a rough estimation of how long a universe
      can last is at least a few billion years, which is already quite impressive,
      isn't it? But can we be sure our universe is the only one? What if Big Bangs
      and Big Collapses are cyclic, like an infinite loop, which no one can break
      even with a Ctrl-C keyboard shortcut? Then it would be few billion years multiplied
      by infinity, which is even more impressive. Obviously, a simple &#8734; looks
      quite euphemistic for a symbol of all of that. And now imagine that every smallest
      moment some choice is possible in every point of space - and each of them creates
      at least two parallel universes.\r\nAnd I have experienced them all - at once.
      I could see everything that could happen in every point of space, any time in
      any of all of &#8734; parallel universes. I could see moments of both my own
      birth and death, also multiplied ''almost'' &#8734; times, ''almost'' - because
      in some universes I had never existed, and I could see whether they were doing
      better without me. I have seen all of the Big Bangs and Big Collapses. Everything
      seems different after such an experience - how can one define everything, anyway?
      And when did such an experience occur? Who can experience it?\r\n\r\nIn what
      we call the real world - either because of ignorance, a shared pact of silence,
      a custom, or just because it seems way simpler that way - the whole thing had
      only lasted a time needed for an eyeblink. But in that very moment my mind had
      changed in all three times at once. I know my knowledge and intelligence had
      developed significantly ever since, but the sacrifice I have done is even more
      terrible. I have lost my peace of mind forever and will never be able to regain
      it.\r\n"

    - "I was coming back home from Graal, as I usually do on Friday evenings. It's
      got quite cold in the past few days, forcing me to wear my jacket and move as
      fast as possible without exposing my neck to the wind, but my curiosity prevailed
      my sense of warmth after I saw four gentlemen carrying what looked like a wooden
      log, but was apparently a human corpse, across the crossroads. I came closer
      when they stopped for a while, and then I realized I knew one of those gentlemen.
      I called his name twice, until he turned his head towards me. His face was showing
      a mild grin of hope.\r\n'Jason!' he called me by my nickname, dating back from
      the good old times at school. 'You're the only man that can help us carry him,
      at least before the police sees us.'\r\n'That's no problem,' I replied. 'I should
      have already been home for ten hours now. My poor old mother certainly won't
      like it. But who cares? One who writes for the famous Elefanto, should always
      be prepared for long-distance corpse carrying.'\r\nSo I took one leg in my hands.
      Then I glanced at the corpse. He was quite young, maybe 16 or 17 years old.
      He must have been alive just a few moments earlier. He had no warm clothes on
      him, his joints were already getting stiff, and his skin was cooling very quickly.
      I wondered, what happened to him at such a young age, as I couldn't see any
      wounds, or even blood, but a quick look at the gloomy faces of my comrades assured
      me in not asking any questions.\r\nIt took us eight hours to take the man back
      to his homeland in Białogard. My legs started to hurt after the first hour,
      my head was bouncing from side to side of exhaustion, but at 6 in the morning
      we put the man on a couch and covered him with a piece of magical Something.
      My new friends have told me, that the man was their friend, who had drunk quite
      a lot this evening, and that he had managed to drink half a liter of vodka,
      together with just four people. He wasn't dead yet, but it was close.\r\nAfter
      they had finished the story, we drunk a hearty Bruderschaft together (man, is
      there such a word in English?), then I said goodbye and walked back home.\r\n\r\nI
      wonder what makes people destroy their lives in such a horrible way. I think
      that, if I ever manage to have grandchildren (or even just children, which is
      quite unlikely - the most beautiful girl in the galaxy, the one from mat-inf-fiz,
      doesn't give a fuck about my existence; I could walk to Częstochowa on my knees
      for that one if weren't a Buddhist), I could sit back in my comfy armchair,
      with my favorite pipe, filled with Amphora tobacco, and tell them:\r\n'Guys,
      when I was 17, I used to carry corpses of young gentlemen of your age, together
      with my friends. And there were always a few beers in that good ol' checked
      jacket of mine.'\r\n"

    - "I'm not a big fan of travel agencies or holiday camps in general, but I made
      an exception this time, and convinced my mother to book a 9-day ski camp in
      Innsbruck. I wouldn't go anywhere with those hungry consumerist bastards of
      human interest for the rest of world, their unwillingness to organize their
      journeys themselves and the horrible pandemic of not reading the agreements
      one signs at all, but, unfortunately, it isn't usually ''that'' easy for a brok
      17-year-old to just go skiing abroad, you know. I could promise never to go
      anywhere, except for skiing, with any of those wandering braineaters (so as
      not to say: vultures, as they're considered the most noble of all birds - they
      never kill for food, you know), but I know enough to know that one never knows.
      I could get infested by Yeerks, you know, and establish a travel agency myself,
      or even just get hired in one of those one day. If so, I would just need to
      make sure I'm not going anywhere with Polish tourists. They're just terrible,
      drinking vodka all the time, speaking in an annoying, arrogant manner and they're
      most often Catholics, as most consumeristic douchebags have grown up in Christian
      families. Russians would do.\r\n\r\nDuring my preparations for the journey,
      I need to make sure there is always some backdoor way of misbehaving, disobedience
      and avoiding taking part in any activities provided by the organizers. During
      a karaoke evening I could play the piano (if there is one) or offer mandalas,
      or even just write the blog on a laptop. I wonder if we're allowed to drink
      alcohol there. I can legally drink in Austria, you know, the drinking age is
      16 there. I could just sit at the bar and have a beer or five every evening,
      but if we're not allowed, I'd have to buy ten beers in some shop every day and
      drink them in my room - we're going to live in some lousy 4-star hotel, you
      know. I have no doubt there will be a sauna and a swimming pool, I just wonder
      about the piano. How can I escape from the hotel to a Diamondway Buddhist Centre?\r\n\r\nMy
      usual association with travel agencies leads to a certain group of people -
      although I know it is not really wise to put people in such chests of drawers.
      Those are the ladies that lie on the beach all day anywhere they go, to achieve
      a nice, reddish suntan (whose color resembles that of diarrhoeal feces of a
      heroin addict), and the gentlemen that work out all day to drive their attention
      straight from the beach to their hotel rooms. Their picture galleries on Facebook
      usually resemble lists of geographical points we have to memorize for the needs
      of our extended-level geography at school. Thus I can meditate and spend my
      time in peace of mind in ''really'' nice spots, with no unwanted companion at
      all. Which one do ''you'' prefer: Porost or Ibiza?\r\n"

    - "A brief glance in the past as the Sunday sun refuses to shine over my lousy
      breakfast. It's 10 o'clock, 20th March 2011.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening. Plastelina,
      a club in the very centre of my dreamtown. The entrance costs 5 zlotys and they
      ask me for ID while buying alcohol. The place itself is decorated in a fairly
      pleasant manner. There are some of my friends, but eventually I start talking
      to a group of dumb girls I would have rather expected to see in Fregata or Zacisze.
      Some Asian-looking chick asks me whether I mind having an Asian girlfriend.
      \"Of course I do!,\" I say. \"I am not suitable for any girl as I'm mean and
      disgusting.\" Then I start telling jokes about dead foetuses. 5 zlotys was way
      too much.\r\nA visit in the library. I read a book about Chinese calligraphy,
      one of those nice books for people with aptitude for drawing that cost the half
      of a Van Gogh painting, but you can read them during one break at school, because
      most of their volume is nice paper. Furthermore, they're glued and won't lie
      flat, and therefore can't be kept open while you're trying to practise calligraphy
      excercises from the book. I don't care about the calligraphy, so I just wrote
      down a few idioms. 杯弓蛇影 (to confuse a reflection of a bow in a glass with a
      snake), 画龙点睛 (to paint the dragon and dots in its eyes). These are nice.\r\n\r\nFriday.
      I remember having drunk beer on the roof of an 11-floor building. However, my
      mobile phone's sent text messages might prove the truth of the fashionable modern
      proverb ''\"Pijesz &mdash; nie pisz\"'' (don't text when you drink). I don't
      mind having written stupid messages if they caused at least mild critics; but
      no, they were left without answer!\r\nMorning. I manage to be 5 minutes late
      in English even though I were already at school 10 minutes before. I tell my
      teacher it's the psychological war.\r\nLong-distance time planning excercise.
      My geography teacher claims that with my current set of grades in her subject
      I will have to see her in August. I guess it's nice, because if I stay in the
      second grade, I could change my class to 1M, because there are nice chicks.
      Everyone around says that my plan is pure madness. Hopefully I will eventually
      have the choice.\r\n\r\nThursday. A test in English. The excercise says to ''make
      questions and answer''.\r\nQuestion 5. ''What's the riskiest thing you have
      ever done''?\r\nMy answer. ''The first riskiest was being born at all, the second
      was not becoming gay, which makes me prone to falling in love with 1M girls.''\r\nThe
      teacher starts to laugh after having read it.\r\n\r\n"

      it.\r\nBut then, when a math.-phys. chick walks nearby looking absolutely hot,
      I can actually feel my brain become soft; the surrounding reality dissolves

      both unconsciously and unwillingly. I should get myself some fireproof clothing

    - "The world is full of magic.\r\nAt least the world of a seventeen-and-a-half
      y.o. simple Nebraska boy from Koszalin, that has been writing his cute little
      Bloggy for almost three years &mdash; which means that I was only 14.5 y.o.
      on the day when I first opened my magical text editor (''gedit Merlin edition'')
      window in an IT lesson at school. Now that I'm so old and arrogant, I don't
      even look in the direction where a person below the magical border of 16 could
      ever pass, remembering all those joyous days of my early youth seems at least
      a bit inadequate; despite, I'll never forget how my world had changed, after
      I've claimed my own bit of space on the Internet.\r\n\r\nThere is magic in the
      people and in their words. And I'm sure, that there has always been some purely
      Pagan magic in space all around. I'm not sure about it's real nature, though.
      Could it possibly be a sort of transcendental vibration in sounds of raindrops
      falling outside on my windowsill? Etherical bits of stardust flying around in
      the wind? The first sip of a love potion (called ''beer'' in Muggle slang),
      drunk on the roof of a certain building with a good friend, with essential darkness,
      emanating from everywhere around? (In case you don't know, a ''real'' city,
      as mine, is never asleep. It is a living organism, whose inhaling and exhaling
      we experience as darkness and light, or 阴 and 阳, that is, yin and yang.) Due
      to my basic ignorance for magical affairs, though, I can never feel that magic
      well enough.\r\nAnd there is certainly a lot of magic in the smile of a girl,
      possibly even more than in Harry Potter's magical wand, (11\" holly, phoenix
      feather core).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I won't sound too posh writing so, but
      I've already seen a mortal girl one day (most probably a Muggle or squib), looking
      at me with some buttery vision simply because some Nebraska faggot has written
      something and then published it to some lousy website (full of bare feet and
      elephants). This may seem weird, compared to the degree of softness of my knees
      in the presence of certain Objects of Interest, most commonly located in <span
      style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">1m</span>, the Math.-IT-Phys. class.\r\n\r\nAnd
      there are many simple moments enchated into certain posts; when I read about
      my psychedelic trip to Mielno in those early days, I can almost feel the sand
      running around my bare feet, as if there were a parallel universe preserved
      in my mind in its essential form, untouched by time and everyday sorrows.\r\n"

    - "'''17th April, 2011.'''\r\nAs I've always said and written here, I like travelling
      in general. Nevertheless, I'm not quite sure, why I need over 8 hours for a
      journey from Warsaw to my dear old home town back in Nebraska, which in fact
      used to take an hour less a few years ago. And the driver of the bus I rode
      to the station was driving in a way that brought on mind being on very hard
      psychedelic drugs, that is, slower than a quantum physician could ever imagine.\r\nI
      would also like to express my deep disappointment for the fact that I have to
      come back to school, now that everyone is already having fun back in Warsaw,
      and everyone else. Goha is going back to Radom, where there's nothing to do,
      and there are just three days left of being mentally fucked in the anus, back
      there at school. I feel a bit uncertain, though, about my grades in certain
      subjects (still nothing unusual).\r\n\r\nI just need another holiday. That's
      the same, that a character in the book I've read recently (that is, ''Lalka''
      by Bolesław Prus) had said and even written in his diary (which is a protoplast
      of bloggies, in case you don't know), just a few weeks before having died on
      heart failure in his chaise longue. Still, I can't deny that I haven't had a
      decent whole night's sleep for zillions of ages. At least I've been to a nice
      party with my cousin, the author of my favourite <a href=\"http://ant8.blogspot.com\">ant8.blogspot.com</a>
      bloggie, and a few dozens of Buddhists; there I have taken tons of sweet pictures
      with a chick 14 years older than me, and so on.\r\nI began to read ''Crime and
      Punishment''.\r\n\r\nI remember now that I've always hoped to eventually become
      a writer. That's not just because some of them earn a lot of money for writing
      just what all those consumeristic consumers want, but I have just always felt
      a writer, just the same way that I like the student lifestyle in general. And
      I will have to change my lifestyle somehow; I guess I've become way too static
      recently. Still, I'll have to do something about my grades, and get some sleep
      first. And I got bored with wild partying for a moment.\r\nThe full moon is
      shining outside my train's window and that reminds me of the only <span style=\"font-variant:
      small-caps;\">1m</span> girl that talks to me at all (and has nice boobs), just
      because she had once said that she liked vampire books. I wonder where the world
      would end up without big-breasted girls.\r\n\r\n"

      No movement.
      The last sentence refers to the weblog of my father's cousin (shall I call him: uncle?), who keeps posting exciting information about his placement on Earth, like "it's still Cracow", "it's Ulan Bator", "Coruscant" or "at a small planet of Naboo". Well, how boring my life could seem, compared to his! I still have four days left to waste because of pangalactic exams going on currently. Unfortunately, no one seems to fancy spending that time with '''me''', though.

      That is, when I write a message to some folks, all they say is usually "Man, I can't, see ya tomorrow!" or "I am currently very busy/Not present in Koszalin/Extraterrestial forms of intelligence have just invited everyone in the universe but you to a pangalactic party with hookers a huge variety of free soft drinks and hard drugs, hahahah LOL you loser" and so on. Meanwhile, most attractive chicks with nothing meaningful to do still prefer to spend their time on their own, at least without me, while attractive chicks, currently needing nothing but my bodily love, are at school or have been evaporated lately, as a result of recent accidents with nuclear evaporators, maaan, what sort of chicks they all were! How lonely I began to feel now that they're gone... Now that everyone is gone... and I have no more money left to waste.

      But it has always been so! There are times when I get involved in wild parties with loads of crazy chicks, but, according to timeless rules, after a period of wild parties comes a wild hangover and everyone just goes home! I get a few phone numbers and text the chicks once or twice, then they become bored; they stop answering my messages and convince their boyfriends to hire an assassin, so that I end up with three problems: boredom, the chick and the assassin... Still, it has nothing to do with the fact that sometimes school is more bearable than it seems; well, maybe not in the high school.

      Then there rang a doorbell. How could that happen at that time? I jumped the way from my piano practising room to the hall (not to confuse with my dancehall, which only exists in the seventh dimension). I opened the door, but as soon as I saw two elderly people with thin coloured magazines in their bags, I already knew who they were and I closed my door, preventing them from stealing my soul through discussion (it's worth way too much hard drugs to let them have it), but they were quicker. The elderly man put his shoe of pure technetium between my door and its frame, so as not to let me escape.
      "Please!" shouted the man. "Take at least a free issue of this interesting magazine."
      "No, thanks," I said.
      "Just a magazine! See, there are interesting articles in this one," said the man enthusiasticly. "For example, have you ever thought about the perfection, with which our human body is designed? Isn't it a proof that it was designed by our perfect Creator?"
      "Well, then mine must have been defective, because what I see is a fragile pile of blood and bones, easily destructible. Breaking your spine might end up with lifelong paralysis..."
      "Look at your eyes! Have you known that no camera has ever been built more precisely and perfectly? Doesn't that prove that it was designed by a god?"
      "Well, I guess it doesn't. It only proves that it was built more precisely and perfectly that any human-built camera. Yet the body in general seems absolutely random."
      "But no man has ever designed a human yet!"
      "If I had over four milliard years of spare time and were as bored as your god, I would create a human too! And it would be way more perfect than this time. Goodbye."

      And I'm left with an issue of this month's ''Awake!''. I have to do it (that is, awake) in a few hours, so farewell, my dear readers! It was 5th May, 2011.

      A brief look at most of my family's blogs seems enough to make me at least a bit embarassed. Not only is my own lousy website not really active, but also for some reason I decided to prolong that '''foreign-sounding comedy''', which really feels a bit weird. Nevertheless, I could at least leave a few words about stuff going on around recently.
      Firstly, a '''weather phenomenon''' &mdash; my father's cousin writes about a thunderstorm in Cracow, and, on the following day, a thunderstorm catches me on my way home from the 5th official <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/">PechaKucha</a> Night in Koszalin. It may seem simple, but it made me feel as if the weather conditions came from the internet. Nevermind.
      Another phenomenon is connected with cities and '''cultural events'''. I have noticed that in Koszalin, there are those periods where nothing interesting is happening and even nothing boring, but when someone actually organizes an event, you can't even make a step, because there is an event on every tile in the pavement, really! There are usually so many of them that nobody can't count them, not to mention visiting a zillionth part. Couldn't they distribute them a bit more evenly? So that I don't get bored on lazy Sundays, but the choice of wild parties on Fridays isn't wider than my vision.

      There is a risk that I might be going to China this year (if I manage to raise my fat buttocks and go get myself a passport before the moment when our Sun turns into a Red Dwarf and '''everything that I have ever loved''' on this planet gets irreversibly demolished). People deserving a postcard could send their addresses to me, but I am quite sure I will forget everything anyway. I went to Milan a few months ago and it wasn't '''that''' interesting &mdash; it seems that most of Italy consists of old buildings and scooters. How boring. Many Italians can't speak English at all and the only way of communicating with them remaining is body language, which only makes sense at a certain level of relationships. How nice it is to learn Chinese and be able to order '''noodles''' in Chinese! Have I said that I loved noodles yet?

      When I ever go running at all (which usually happens once an eon or only slightly more frequently), I always try to choose a path which nobody walks. I have already experienced so many weird, annoying encounters while running that never let me go on running; therefore today, when I was suffering from an excessive amount of energy, circulating in my subtle bodies, I decided to have a short run on the path to Jamno. Who could walk there?
      ...and then I saw a lonely teenage girl, walking her dog, and realized that I knew her.
      'Walking your dog again, huh?' I said.
      'Yeah,' said Weronika from the second hum-jour class, for whom I have already written a short poem, which she liked. The history of that <a href="/posts/Postcard for Weronika">poem</a> is on its most profound level connected with our last skiing expedition, which I don't really associate with much more than good companion, cheap beer and monotonous menu (Wiener Schnitzel; Wiener Schnitzel mit Pommes; Wiener Schnitzel mit Kartoffeln und Gemüsesalat; Pommes mit Pommes; Pommessalat mit Pizza und Cola). Just because drinking alcohol was so strictly prohibited for such youngsters as we, I felt constrained to drink as much as possible every day, even if the beer was so terrible and cheap (Zillertaler Wei&szlig;bier; Paulaner Wei&szlig;bier; Erdinger Wei&szlig;bier mit Pommes, Kartoffelsalat und Wiener Schnitzel).
      Coming back to the lonely teenage girl.
      'Where is the admirer, which used to help you walk your dog?'
      'He has died because of the excessive amount of love to me,' she said. (Actually, she didn't, but the true reason for his absence doesn't really play any major role in the plot, which is also missing).
      'Could I help you with your lovely dog (and it's even prettier mistress) on a more regular basis, then?'
      'No, I don't think so.'
      A few lines later she told me that her dog's eyes were as pretty and dark as hers, so I looked in her eyes, only to realize they were big and dark enough to outshine the Sun and a few other objects. Why must there be so many pretty chicks around? It's just as monotonous as the choice of beer in Austria!

      There once was a careless professor who was terribly busy with his everyday work and loved reading books in his spare time. His wife was very displeased with it, so one day she said to him:
      'It would be great if I became one of your books.'
      The professor felt very strange about this, so he asked her why.
      'This way I could spend time with you.'
      Professor's face turned red of embarassment and quickly said:
      'No, no, this is impossible. You know that after I finish reading a book I always take another one.'
      When his wife heard it, she replied sadly:
      'Then I will become the big dictionary, lying on your desk.'

      I have heard that beginning one's lectures and articles with good jokes is generally considered a sign of good sense of humor and good taste. It's not that I am trying to make anybody believe in my good taste, and this joke isn't in fact really funny. But it's often quite nice to tell jokes which are not more dirty than all the world's homeless and Redtube combined. And it's a nice addition to this post's main point, which is another essay that I have written for my dearest English teacher, (not because I care about doing homeworks at all, I just like having fun of other people, lolz). I couldn't quite remember the subject she has given to me, so I thought out a new one. Hope you like it.

      '''Essay. Should children in general like going to school? Why? Why not?'''

      <em>In most countries in the world school is now compulsory. This results in ceaseless discussions between the students themselves, teachers and governments. Should children like going to school? In my essay I'll try to explain my own point of view for this subject.</em>
      <em>There is no doubt that some elementary things taught at school are really useful or necessary in our everyday life. These include, among others, the ability to communicate effectively with the outer world through reading and writing, counting money and knowing the way children are born. The rest is mostly rubbish, although we still need it to be respected in modern societies. No wonder most kids hate learning, just as they don't really treasure garbage.</em>
      <em>However, contrary to the common belief, there are also some good reasons for liking it. Firstly, at school one can meet trillions of interesting people which share our slavish destiny. Secondly, it is often a good way to spend some time when no good parties are organised in our town, and in winter, when it's just too cold to spend time outdoors.</em>
      <em>I am deeply convinced we should try to learn as much as possible, as </em>with understanding comes liberation<em>. Even so, I think that a healthy dose of hatred for school and one's teachers is needed to protect one from most mental diseased caused by going to school.</em>

      There is a chance I will finally go to China when I get myself a passport.

      Now that I've been back home for over a week, I guess that my vacations should have better not started. Okay, I'm flying to Beijing in August, for almost three weeks, but until then I am grounded here in Koszalin, and have to go ''busking'' every day to earn money for the whole trip. That's how it looks like in theory. In fact, I was caught into daily routine again. I get up at some point of the day, then I have to play the trumpet, do a bit of sport in order to prevent getting fat, offer some ''mandalas'', then I either go ''busking'' or not.

      Now, for those who don't know yet, the term ''busking'' means performing some sort of art, e.g. playing a musical instrument, painting, dancing, acting, reciting poetry or being a ''living statue'' in pedestrian areas, like old towns in popular and fashionable cities, in order to get donations from wealthy, drunk people passing by. Of course, almost no buskers like the ''living statues'', as they don't really have to do anything, save standing still in fancy clothing, and they usually earn way more money than those who needed years of practising on the trumpet, as I do. I used to like that job, because it's way more interesting than sitting somewhere reading books for 8 hours a day.

      OK, I didn't go busking today. The weather forecast for Koszalin claimed it would start to rain around half past seven, which would be like the time I usually start playing. So I've said to my mother this morning:
      "Well, I'm not sure if I'm going there today, for it's supposed to be pouring with rain at half past seven."
      "If so, do it the way it starts raining ''after'' you've finished playing," she replied.
      And then, when a few drops of water fell on my head, I thought it would probably start to rain heavily in a few seconds. It's 22.38 and it still hasn't really rained. I have wasted an evening of playing. ''Scheiße Autobahn''.

      And in the evenings, after I have come back from work, I usually meet some friends (of those few remaining) and go for a beer or two, not because I want to party, but because I have nothing better to do at home. I wonder if it wouldn't be better if I had a boring, 8-hour job selling ice-cream or even frying fish.

      I've got a book in German to learn from. It's title is ''Keine Angst vorm Lieben. 49 erotische Abenteuer'' (''No fear of making love. 49 erotic adventures'') and I have learned quite a few funny words for genitals, but not really much useful, everyday vocabulary. 25 days left to Beijing.

      It's Gdańsk.
      I'm here to apply for a visa for the trip to Beijing, planned for August (7th-28th). I couldn't help but get here a day in advance and stay in the local Buddhist centre, which in fact is quite a good way to stay. It costs only 15 zł, and for that price one gets a roof over one's head, access to a shower, a nice kitchen and a lot of room for meditation.
      The only problem is that I still miss some young single student with huge boobs and own flat. It might be difficult to fall asleep in such circumstances, but it is definitely more pleasant.
      My dad's mantra "don't make me to a grangpa" is still following me.
      I finished the book ''The Foreigner'' (''Cudzoziemka'') on the train and I can proceed to reading Stieg Larsson's ''The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo''.

      When I was 13 or 14, I wanted to learn to play the accordion. I even joined an accordion band (whose name I'd better just not reveal), but eventually my accordion career wasn't very long. The only song I ever learned to play was a Polish folk song called ''My little quail ran away'' (Pol.: ''Uciekła mi przepióreczka''). The lyrics tell a touching story of a young boy whose quail ran away onto a field of millet. The boy wanted to chase her barefoot, but needed to ask his mother in advance whether he was allowed to catch the bird or not.

      Now there are a few similarities between my life and life of the boy whose quail ran away. Now the quail may be the allegory of money running away from my eyesight; it can also represent girls who run away as soon as they see my disgusting face and the degree of the development of my adispose tissue. The boy goes barefoot, the same as I used to do a few years ago. He has to ask his mother questions concerning his own quail, which means he is supressed by rules and stereotypes. An old Zen proverb says: ''True liberty means that someone tells you to put on a red shirt and you put it on.''

      Missing one's career bus means choosing a wrong path. I've been pretending to play the trumpet for seven years now and the only reason why I haven't given it up yet is because it's kind of not cool to give up playing just a year before graduation. Even so, there still are some people who say I play my trumpet well and that I've got some musical talent. Well, I know a couple of folks in my school who practise way more, do it way better, who haven't lost the rest of their interest in music decades ago in favour of Diamond Way Buddhism and full shaped chicks with nice personalities. Many of the mentioned trumpeters are a few years younger. Are there really so many born virtuosos in Koszalin? Or should I consider it an undeniable proof that I'm in no way the best?
      And the talent? I don't believe in talents. There are congenital predispositions, interests & hobbies, and a lot of time spent on it. There were times when I thought I would study I.T. and become a famous programmer or so. Then I thought it's kinda boring to sit somewhere, damage one's eyes and just wasting time one could use to learn Chinese. But before I gave up my interest in computers, I've learned quite a few computer tricks, like basic usages of Linux and its console, no-look typing in two keyboard layouts (QWERTY & Dvorak), and some knowledge about websites which enabled me to create the website you're reading. Does it mean that I have any computer talents? No, it only means that I spend a lot of time at computer and therefore cannot play football at all, nor swim. Am I talented?

      Should I eat Beijing roast duck in Beijing or better avoid consuming meat? 18 days to Beijing.

      Home in Koszalin, then Gdańsk and back home in one day. A bit too exhausted too write, but I think I can do it.

      What made me so exhausted, then?
      It could probably be the yesterday night's party at Plastelina club. There were four of us: Sochal, my brother, Maurycy, with whom I'm going to Beijing, and I. Although we came together, we split after a while. I went on with my usual club activities, that is: consuming alcohol for other people's money, talking to some chicks and trying to get into some closer bodily contact without succeeding. Around 3 o'clock in the evening, a friend of mine, Żebro (Polish for a rib), said that she was going back home in the same direction. We went out of the club.

      And then she did it. She took off her shoes and we walked all the way through the town barefoot. I accompanied her all the way to her home and came back home alone. I went to sleep after four, after having consumed all the rests of Maurycy's pasta with bacon, cheese and eggs (a loose interpretation of ''spaghetti alla carbonara'', a popular Italian dish) and chatting a while on my mobile phone, using the great Symbian version of Facebook Chat. Getting up at 8.30 has never been that hard. Or maybe it has.

      I wanted to buy myself a coffee or something similar in Słupsk, but in the railway station there was a nice second-hand bookshop. I ended up with a 12 zł ''Rick Steves' Europe Through the Back Door 1996'' guide, full of profound wisdom and travel tips. This guy went on a two month trip around Europe with three shirts and a T-shirt. Anyway, I can't really try ''all'' those packing tips because my mother demands me to take a huge purple plane bag with wheels. Many other tips sound reasonable.

      I got my Chinese visa. 16 days to Beijing.

      It's Koszalin again.

      I could have probably written something earlier, e.g. when I came back home after having spent 18 days in China, when I turned 18 on 14th September, or when the school started. It could have become quite a long post, though. And looking back into the past shows clearly that writing ''a lot'' doesn't always mean having more to say. And my English teacher keeps saying that unless I learn to limit my works to matura standards, my matura works won't even be checked in the real exam. So, why don't I try to write all I want to say in 200-250 words?

      Thus, the beginning of the story is coming back from China. I spent 18 days in Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing, together with the godson of my mother, and you can see most of the pictures on my Facebook profile.

      Then I went to school. One of my main activities now is trying to take sweet pictures with pretty chicks. I got myself one with Wang Xin, but the picture is still in China; one with Grażyna Torbicka and one with Kasia from the class <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">2m</span>.

      Lastly, I'm 18 now and I can do most of the things I would have never dreamed of before. But I don't. I'm just sitting in the kitchen, sipping from a bottle of wheat beer. Beer is beautiful.

      Ok, I admit that I haven't written anything for quite a long time. I simply had nothing to say. Okay, but now I would like to tell you something about ''books''.

      You see, recently I've been reading quite a lot of them. In fact, some people were feeling disgusted by that fact and asked me how many books I actually do read a day. It's not really that extreme (although I would really like to possess the ability to read photographically, seems quite useful for school), but I tried to count them. So, in the period from 1st Oct. till today (24th Oct.) I have read the following books: <ul><li>''Heart of Darkness'' by Joseph Conrad,</li><li>''In the Shade of Gods'' by Sidney Sheldon,</li><li>half of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' by Nietzsche, too difficult for me,</li><li>''In Cold Blood'' by Truman Capote,</li><li>one radio drama by Friedrich Dürrenmatt (''Der Doppelgänger''),</li><li>and finally, ''Grobowiec Wielkiego Szamana'' (''Tomb of The Great Shaman'') by Sławomir Sierecki, (Wydawnictwo Morskie, Gdynia 1968).</li></ul> You may consider this list boring and just stop reading this post, but if you have nothing against it, I'll say something about the latter.

      The book is a fictional story of a Polish journalist who went to Mongolia to gather materials for his novel about the life of Genghis Khan. There is nothing wrong with the story itself, I was just wondering: why do almost all the characters speak either fluent literary English or Russian? I know that it is generally more common for people travelling all around the world to speak some foreign languages, but it is very hard for me to believe that the Mongolians, even in Ulan Bator, which was still the middle of nowhere back in '68, when the book was written, could speak either Russian or English on such a level&hellip; okay, maybe that's not really that impossible. But in every realistic novel, simple people speak simple language.

      But there was another example. A few decades ago, there was a popular Polish book series about ''Pan Samochodzik'', an office worker solving difficult criminal problems in a great style. And all of his co-workers could speak fluent English, German and Russian, isn't it weird? I mean, even nowadays, when we can learn almost every single language we want, when I want to tell someone a German joke and want them to understand it, I have to find either a German or someone after the German studies. Hopefully what I told about was just the fault of the censors.

      Okay, and I want to tell you what changed around in a clear, understandable way.
      The guinea-fowl is still shiny and beautiful, but the rooster realised she just wasn't worth it so he gave up.
      The cow became a doe and all the deer at the rut are growling.
      The dove came with an olive branch and announced the closeness of dry land, but it turned out it was made of plastic.
      I met my English teacher in the corridor and I told her bad morning, she said that she didn't like me either.

      I took part in the Autumn Spelling Competition today. The event was organized by my school and took place in our school's gym, as usual. The second stage, which only the best ten people to write the dictation could enter, consisted of two parts: a short test, checking one's ability to read IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), and spelling, which means that a native speaker (here an 18 y.o. American girl from the student exchange) reads aloud ten words and one has to spell them in English.

      For example, she is holding a piece of paper and says a word like HANDKERCHIEF twice. Now all those poor folks who did very well in the dictation (a passage from ''The Loneliness on the Net'' by Janusz L. Wiśniewski containing ridiculous words like ''sarcophagi'' or ''a bottle of cold Chardonnay'',) try to say ''H-A-N-D-K-E-R-C-H-I-E-F'' or ''M-O-T-H-E-R-[a gesture representing a hyphen]-I-N-[a gesture representing a hyphen]-L-A-W'' as properly as they can.

      We were listening. We &mdash; I mean, two people I already know; Ala, a nice first-grader and I. We were pretending to be stressed at first, but when I realized that I keep mixing up letters, I became really wild.

      I didn’t win. Some second-grader, some almost-American, did. Anyway, we all got those nice Empik gift vouchers &mdash; meaning a nice sum of money for books, in my case. I gave two of them to two of my classmates, 50&nbsp;zł each, and I bought ''The Good Soldier Švejk'', the book with DVD. My mother was so angry when she heard it! Can't she understand the law of cause and effect? Doesn’t she know how beneficial generosity is? She often says, ''if you want to be generous, do it with your own money''. Yo, wasn’t it my money?

      And there were free cakes and cookies and coffee. Ala, that first-grader, said that the cake was her mother's. I'll become so freaking ugly and fat again if I keep eating that stuff! And one of those girls in charge of cookies was so wildly pretty, and she's from Ala's class. I'll have to get her number, or something.

      The Idol came to Koszalin. Everyone was cheering. Chicks were deifying his unearthly beauty. All the music fans dressed up and went to his concert. I didn't. I'd rather sit in the library and write, if you ask.

    - "On Saturday, 14th Jan., 2012 I woke up late and feeling a bit dizzy. I had
      a nasty headache which meant I must have been drinking the night before. Had
      I? Oh really? And why? The following post is a brief explanation of how it happened.
      Well, in fact it isn't, but I haven't written for such a long time that nothing
      really matters.\n\nWe're living in horrible times, you know? I'm constantly
      feeling some undefined anxiety. I keep dreaming of things I don't have or don't
      deserve to have, and even if I get them, I'm still not happy. Sometimes I wake
      up in the middle of the night just to realize I'll never be perfectly happy.
      Around New Year, maybe a week or so earlier, I decided to develop a certain
      attitude towards a little blonde, a year younger, named Kasia (some of the more
      loyal readers have even met her in person). There was nothing wrong about it,
      but the feeling began to fade out slowly, and I ended up being a kind of cold
      bitch again. In the meantime I got so much inspired that I wrote a poem called
      [[Kiedy byłem bytem astralnym]] (English: [[When I was an astral body]]) and
      a few pages of an unfinished short story under a code name <a href=\"http://elefanto.cba.pl/chomiczowka.pdf\">Chomiczówka</a>.\n\nWriting
      a poem may turn out to be such a lot of fun, you know. I couldn't sleep at night
      again (it's happening more and more often lately) and I knew I had to write
      a poem which I could call ''When I was an astral body''. The result goes here:
      [[Kiedy byłem bytem astralnym]] or [[When I was an astral body]].\n\nAnd now
      I have a holiday which will last two weeks. That is connected to an interesting
      phenomenon which I noticed lately. For example, yesterday I got up at 7.30,
      which is amazing on holiday. I managed to go to German lesson, have lunch, meditate
      for half and hour, then go to music school and in the end it was 4 o'clock in
      the afternoon. What happened to all that time I was supposed to possess? Has
      anyone else noticed anything similar? Is there an astral body stealing the time
      I save or what? I mean, it's not really a pleasant feeling to run out of time,
      is it?\n\nAnd just one last thing. I searched for my name (Karol, in case you
      forgot) in the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/\">Urban Dictionary</a>
      and the result was:\n\t\nThe cutest girl with the deepest eyes. It's said that
      if you look into a Karol's eyes for longer than just a few seconds, a trance
      will be set upon you, and you will be infatuated with her for approximately
      one lifetime. She also has the cutest smile and the greatest walk, which are
      almost as lovely as her voice (the greatest voice in the world).\nGuy1- \"Hey...
      You've been smiling for over a week now... What's up?\" \nGuy2- \"...Karol said
      'Hi' to me... :)\"\n\nThat's the cutest interpretation of my name I have ever
      seen, even though I'm not a girl, really!\n"

      Oh this post is just to check whether it's possible to do it on Android. Looks like it is. I'm afraid that getting such a powerful toy which I can carry all along might mean the end to my productivity, which was not so gorgeous anyway. I have already downloaded a couple dozen interesting applications, including a Gameboy Advance emulator, Google's My Tracks and something for the e-books. Though I'm not sure if I'll still have any interest in books when I can finally play Pokemon on my mobile... Lol, and a friend of mine bought some Chinese tablet with Android for around a hundred bucks, and he uses it with a mouse because its screen is so terrible.

      I woke up with my head aching again. But now I'm perfectly sure that I wasn't drinking the night before. It just doesn't seem right you know. Oh come on, I know that the times when I was in junior high school were not exactly perfect, but I'm sure there was a time when I could get up at 6.35 every day and not be in agony two hours later. But do I really want those times to come back?

      In the "Language Hacking Guide", which I found almost accidentaly, it is strongly recommended to keep track of one's gradual advance in a "language learning log". It is also said that a blog which some people read or comment all the time is a great motivation to keep on learning.

      So right now I'm quite sure that after all the school mess I have to be facing until middle of May, I am still going to be learning some interesting foreign languages, and I will probably need your support to stay diligent. So, if there is someone who's still reading my blog and wants me to continue trying to achieve my silly goals, please raise your hands. Raised? Okay, now if you could '''please''' leave a comment under this post or any other, it would be really kind of you. I don't care what language it's written in as long as you don't insult me in a way I could understand.

      I also have to warn you that any comment without a signature would be lost forever. Thanks for everything and bye!

    - "It's Sunday, 19th February. A long time has passed since I last visited this
      place, but hardly anything has changed. I am still a high school student and
      I'm trying to enjoy the last months as much as possible. Last Tuesday was probably
      the very last opportunity for me to send a valentine. Valentine's Day is the
      most important time of year for people in relationships, epileptics as well
      as gift and flower shops. Everybody in my school was more than welcome to get
      a ready-made card for just a quid, fill it in and forget everything with a feeling
      of having done their duties with little effort. \n\nWe shall leave this way
      to the sycophants and to those who care about love. What I did was to buy a
      purple-coloured piece of cardboard and glued dozens of colourful clippings from
      a few magazines available (Italian ''Playboy'' and Polish ''Twój Weekend'',
      for instance) almost randomly, except for the address and the message (''someone
      loves you I wonder who lol'') inside. The card (<a href=\"/posts/Valentine for
      Little Kasia\">view it</a>) was somehow delivered and the recipient (in that
      case, little Kasia from the class <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps\">1m</span>)
      could somehow figure out who the author was, even though it wasn't signed. And
      well, I spent three hours thinking, cutting and gluing and got only a brief
      &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in return. Come on.\n\nThe weather is far from perfection.
      All the snow that was lying around is melting, which on the one hand is nice,
      because  it meams that the air temperature is back above zero, but on the other
      hand it is impossible to walk some paths now, I mean, without a boat. The streets
      of my beloved town are deserted. Many people refrain from going anywhere in
      relatively unpleasant conditions. Some prefer using public transportation rather
      than the muscle-powered means of transport.\n\nWe shall leave this way to the
      sycophants and those patient enough not to lose their minds on the Polish roads.
      Even if there is a single person in the Universe who would still deny the fact
      that the bicycle is, at least in some conditions, the best means of transport,
      they most probably know that they're wrong anyway.\n\nMy P.E. teacher keeps
      criticising my general laziness in his classes, which might probably have something
      to do with the fact that I don't give a damn about the silly team games that
      we're forced to play. He says that I don't respect the fact that I've got a
      healthy body, while the disabled do all sorts of sports in spite of the numerous
      hindrances.\n\nWe shall leave this way to those who don't know about the impermanence
      of all things. I'd rather have fun my own way than play football with people
      who are not in posession of transcendental wisdom.\n \n"

    - "It's Gdańsk. I have just spent quite a pleasant weekend, even though I couldn't
      play the trumpet or learn anything about baroque literature (what a pity!).
      However, although I was deprived of those fascinating activities, I managed
      to:<ul><li>go clubbing with three girls (let's just call them Gonia, Dosia and
      Liu Wendan) and my brother and waste all the money for which I wanted to come
      back,</li><li>teach history of music in Chinese to two Chinese girls, quite
      exhausting.</li></ul>I was surprised how expensive a weekend in a city that
      close to Koszalin can turn out to be.\n \nLast Thursday the weather in Koszalin
      was so sunny that I decided to go cycling. I made a short ride around the city
      with my mobile phone, equipped with GPS, in my pocket. I created a map of the
      route I went using an app called My Tracks &mdash; <a href=\"http://maps.google.pl/maps/ms?msid=200680316258167451616.0004b9a7b03a7c6be177c&msa=0\"
      target=\"_blank\">have a look</a>. The stats are not quite impressive &mdash;
      the track recorded by the program is just 10.41 km long, but keep in mind all
      the obstacles, like strong wind, poor condition of my bike, and that I have
      had no summer since last July, so I'm a bit out of shape.\n \nI wonder why my
      brother didn't notice the building next to his dormitory until I pointed it
      to him. Even more weird is that the window in his room, at which I am sitting
      right now, typing, overlooks the said building.\n \nI need to write more. I
      envy my uncle a bit, the one that has written a post almost everyday ever since
      he started with it. It's not that nothing happens. Even if I'm in Koszalin,
      even if I just go to school, have lunch, sit at home drinking coffee, reading
      e-books and complain how bored I am, there is still a lot going on around me:
      sometimes I meet interesting new people, or I bump into old friends. It looks
      like I shouldn't spend so much time at home.\n"

    - "I am usually quite stubborn and can sometimes be very determined, at least
      when it comes to things I like, but I could never really save money. There were
      times when I stored unimaginable amounts of money, up to 300 zł in cash in a
      drawer. Every time it began, I was deeply convinced that I could finally control
      myself and keep on saving until I'd collected a more serious sum.\n\nAnd every
      time I was so convinced, all the money was gone in a week. An obvious attempt
      to stop the tendency would be locking up the money somewhere, preferably not
      in cash, so as not to end up opening an armored piggy bank to buy drugs. I considered
      an investment as the most obvious solution, but it turned out these are all
      intended for really rich people, that is, in possesion of at least 500 zł. \n\nI
      asked two friends who are more experienced in being adult if there is a solution
      and they suggested a deposit account. The deal is simple: money can be stored
      for free but only withdrawn once a month. For every other withdrawal attempt
      you lose 10 zł. After visiting my bank's website it turned out that I don't
      even have to sign any documents, and I can do anything from home.\n\nThis way
      I hope to save some money for my expensive summer holidays abroad. It's going

      For some reason I suddenly remembered a certain morning in March of the previous year, when I woke up suddenly after a dream. I dreamt of holding a certain girl from the class \textsc{1m} &mdash; now \textsc{2m}, with which I was madly in love at that time. I remembered how disappointed I was upon waking up. And yet&hellip; the sun outside was shining so beautifully. Why didn't I notice it?

      A party was organised at my place last Saturday. No, I didn't do it. I just told a group of pals that my mother was going to be on duty, and they called and invited themselves. I was quite glad to be relieved of having to leave the house. I even managed to meet two charming young ladies at the party, although the word &ldquo;get to know&rdquo; might be a bit more appropriate. With it I mean the fact that I already knew both: the first one I already knew by sight, which isn't really odd if we've been going to the same school for the past two and a half years; the other one I met almost eight years ago and haven't had much contact with ever since, so the acquaintance sort of&hellip; expired. We were all drinking pretty badly, but I hope we could have another party (hopefully with a few more girls) in the closest future.

      My new mission: to achieve fluency in both written and spoken English. I might need that in case something goes wrong with my education.

      Yesterday was the hottest day in this year as far, and Friday. Unfortunately, I had so many classes that I only broke free around five o'clock. I definitely like spring. All day long I felt as if it were June and was terribly disappointed that it weren't holidays yet. I kept seeing a picture of myself dressed in light clothing and drinking very cold beer in a sunny garden of Eden.

      I managed to go out in the evening.

      Today I had a really nasty argument with my mother about eating cheese. It's been the same one all the time for 9 years now. Then a Jehova's Witness knock, knocked on my door to invite me to the Last Supper. This must mean I'm eating my Last Breakfast right now. Goodbye, then. I won't miss you.

      Now I know that spring has definitely started. Not only have the temperatures reached as much as 15 degrees, but also the enthusiasm, with which my friends and I go out on weekends have raised a lot. And they breed like mad! When I'm with them I feel as if it were the famous Woodstock festival and Jimi Hendrix were just about to play. The other Moroz is madly in love. And although a year ago the drinking group consisted of a few frustrated guys, a few girls have spontaneously joined us. Some of them are even quite beautiful.

      I'm the only one that's not madly in love in anyone at the moment. One of the only two of us.

      Today's post is about being late. For instance, I have developed a terrible habit of being constantly late for school. It has never been so bad before I went to Broniewski High School. During the first term in my first grade, I managed to only be late two or three times at all. But I also noticed very quickly that no one cared if I was late or not, even if my delay was very long. So in the other term there were already weeks when I was late eight times.

      I don't think anyone has ever given me a good reason to avoid being late. Every day when I'm leaving for school, it looks like all the external conditions were plotting against me. Firstly, I have to put on my socks and shoes, unless it's summer and I only put sandals or &mdash; in the past &mdash; no shoes at all. Then I still have to pack all the most necessary items. The list's contents vary on time of the year, but almost always include a few constant positions, like a good book to read, a working pen or pencil and my notebook. I think most of you know that I wanted to become a writer all the time since my early childhood, but it took me many years to realize how essential carrying a notebook is. During periods of intensive work on my last sixteen novels, I used to carry my Olivetti&nbsp;84 typewriter and a ream of paper, while in summer I put my skateboard in my backpack when I'm not using it at the moment. When the n-th repetition of the whole packing procedure is over, it often turns out that I need a drink. As a result, when I arrive at school, it often turns out that the lessons ended long ago and I could as well never have come. But I always ''do'' go out. There are several reasons for that. One is that I am accustomed to going to school and I would have nothing interesting to do at home, anyway. Another one is that my mother tells me to do so, although she isn't really a good example herself, as she is always at least half an hour late for work. Recently I heard her say on the phone in the morning: 'I'm terribly sorry, but I can't talk to you at the moment, because I need to hurry to work.' It really sounded like a joke, just like when my brother went to a party once and had to promise he would not drink alcohol.

      And there is another joke (read on the ''Suche Żarty'' group on Facebook):
      <em>'You know, Natasha, my failproof spy watch indicates you have no panties on you.'
      'Your failproof watch is wrong, Bond.'
      'Oh, sorry. Looks like it's half an hour fast.'</em>
      I took my genuine Rolex watch to school to use it as a prop for the joke. The watch itself has a long history. I bought it in Beijing Earth Park for 30 RMB and it ceased to work after a few days. A friend of mine suggested that I could go to a watchmaker and have it adjusted and the battery changed for around 20 Zloty, and it would be working nice then. The problem was that it would be more than I originally paid for it.

      I didn't have many opportunities to tell the joke, because I have only had a lesson and a half, but I had a lot of time to write instead. I went to ''Komisja Wojskowa'' (does anyone know the proper word for that?), only to find out that I am ''fit as a fiddle'' &mdash; that is an idiom that have never used before and that I had to check. I would say I'm ''zdrów jak ryba'' &mdash; ''healthy as a fish'' in Polish. I didn't know what to tell them when they asked me about my interests, so I only told them I like languages.

      I need to write more in Chinese by hand. I know the words but I keep forgetting what the characters are. For instance, I checked 耽误 four times but I keep forgetting it. I will have to know more characters if I'm going to be a good translator.

      I would probably write something more, but the events of the last evening, combined with past week's lack of sleep, made me not get up before 10.47 AM. I know that for many of you can't see anything wrong about it, but I belong to that part of society which hates to waste the day on sleeping. The proportions range between around 34:28 in most European societies to 50:10 in Latin America, according to a completely made up statistics. But that was not the point.

      I would like to tell you the last evening's story. It's not going to be interesting or unusual. There are simply very few events in my life that a true adventure seeker would find exciting, so if you fall asleep while reading, please don't bother expressing it in the comments below. But something weird started when I first read a ["blog post":http://toniezabawa.blog.pl/dziewietnasty-marca,15631950,n] by my father's cousin:

      bq. "Crucial for all that is the fact that the natural environment that I need for writing the blog, is back available. In a correctly parked car, with a laptop equipped with a new battery, with the sun hanging still quite high above the horizon, with a door window slid down, and no crackling cold behind it, but a quite pleasant wind at the temperature of around ten degrees Celsius, consuming amber liquid, thus I'm writing."

      I was obsessed. Consuming amber liquid in a parked car? On a pleasant spring evening? The thought seemed like ["Paradise":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G4isv_Fylg] to me. But there were still a few problems to solve:
      * if you drink and drive, you can easily lose your driving license,
      * but I had no driving license to lose,
      * and no car.

      Then, on a Friday evening of 23rd of March, a Beautiful Young Lady (whose name begins with the letter M) sent me a text message saying that she could get me somewhere with her car. Around ten o'clock I was taken with a red Peugeot&nbsp;206, along with another Beautiful Young Lady (whose name begins with the letter I,) to a shop, where I was bought a large supply of amber liquid, and then we went to Jamno to the ferry harbour. And I Did It! In a parked car!

      I didn't write a blog post, though. As most of you know, writing a truly good blog post is by no means easy. The truest stories are always written by life itself. I doubt if I'll ever get near that point in my writing.

      I woke up early in the morning, and only to find out that there was nothing to eat at home. I only had enough time to either go get some bread, or to eat what was left--that is, not really much. Both options required pretending that I can live without Cheese and fresh Tomatoes. But what's the point of getting up if you have no Cheese or Tomatoes?

      But nothing has ever been really logical in my world, so I got up and went to school all the same. I managed to only be late 25 minutes for the first lesson, Polish. We were talking about Romantic Dramas. I used to like this topic. Maybe because my life was always a Romantic Drama. There have been unhappy karmic relationships, political __Kogel Mogel__ and paranormal influences. It was mysterious and gloomy, and Marta says that she had always had eternal __Weltschmerz__. And yet I'm not complaining. I was told about yet another poetry competition and I consider giving them my best love poem so far (and with hints of autoeroticism), "Dla Oli L":/posts/48. But who would print an autoerotical poem in a school magazine? And what's the point of giving away love poems if it is definitely not going to be printed anyway?

      At least it looks like I'm going to Vienna for Easter. I will have to spend 12 hours in the car, but Books are known to be Read during Long Journeys, and I heard that reading Books is Beneficial. Then, I will have a lot of opportunities to visit Important Historical Places, but I'm not even sure if I manage to rent a bicycle and go to the University of Vienna to inquire about my potential studies. All that I've read on the Web was a bit too beautiful to be true. I might manage to the Buddhist Meditation Centre and meet a few local Buddhists. Then, I'll definitely manage to have a few Decent Talks in Austrian and meet many Interesting People. I will bring a few beers home to give them to some better friends. And the best part is that I'm *not* going with any member of my family. Well, and what's the point of going anywhere if a Stubborn Mother keeps telling you to come back home before 11 or... or... well, most Stubborn Mothers are known to claim that they always know better.

      But all the same, what's the point? WHAT'S THE POINT of Life, Universe and Everything?!

      Ciao, Bella. I keep Walking, because Walking calms me down.

      I need to complain that I was Told Off today by my German teacher. She said that others complained that my attitude to the preparations for the German Language Olympics was terribly nonchalant, and that I was showing off with how little I learn. Some people have even suggested that my going to Poznan for the final may have no sense. Oh, yeah, and I think saying so isn't just Groundless Bullshit. Everyone knows that there were loads of students in Broniewski High School who ever managed to get through to the final; that dozens of them are sighted every single day. There are definitely going to only be more and more, now that we finally have our two single periods a week, filled with joyous laughter, innovative learning techniques and that every single kid explodes with enthusiasm at the sole thought of being allowed to finally learn vocabulary by heart and adjust to matura exam standards. Yeah, totally.

      I am not going to indicate precisely whom I suspect of having said so, but this person may be one of the teacher staff's numerous Venerable Old Men. I poo on you, Polish Education System, in which no one matter's if they're not a bishop's child. I don't care what the teachers are going to do to me if they find out that I'm not "respecting their authority":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIVHNylH1Mk.

      Frankly speaking, I had to force myself to write all that. It isn't easy to still be angry after a meditation session, even if it's quite short. But I just thought those words had to be written down. You don't have to be weird to think that Poland is governed by idiots. You're not a betrayer if you want to break free. I'm leaving. I'm leaving as soon as I pass my matura exam or not. I promise.

      Название этой статьи совсем не связанное ни з ком. Это просто предложение, которое я сегодня увидел на стене, когда я шел на бассейн. На стенах и оградах в целой Польше (и, наверное, в целом мире) вобще пишат очень много умных предложений. На пример, в Гданьске, где сейчас живет мой брат и несколько других классных людей, в подземным переходе (тих есть в Гданьске невероятно много), я однажды увидел такой текст: „Друзья как будто тихие ангелы, которые подносят наши крылья, когда они забыли, как летать”.

      В некоторых городах предложения, написанные на стенах почти как сокровищницы древней мудрости. Этак в начале апреля я поехал в Вену. Уже раньше ведомо было, что я планирую переехать в Вену, но когда я в первый раз увидел этот город, я сразу решил переехать туда на всегда. Или хотя бы на пять лет. Нетрудно понять, почему Вена нравится мне лучше чем Кошалин. Во-первых, улицы и дома весде где я был были очень красивые и хорошо поддерживаные. Во-вторых, в Австрии можна заработывать много денег. Если найти хорошую работу -- чрезвычайно много денег. Во-третих, там есть невероятно много иностранцев, которые говорят на всех языках мира, в том числе по-русски, по-китайски, по-чешски и по-итальянски. Временами можна найти австрейцев, которые умеют так хорошо говорить по-немецки чтобы все их поняли, а однажды в Вене я ехал на трамвае возле семьи, в которой все члены говорили и по-немецки, и по-русски. Только поляков я много не встретил. Они, наверное, все вернулись домой на Пасху.

      It's Szczecinek. I probably won't be staying here for too long, as it is just a stop on my way to Warsaw today. I wanted to write this post for a week or so already, but I was so busy with leaving Koszalin that I couldn't just sit and type it. And as you know, once you open Facebook, you cease to be creative anyway. I have finished high school and sat all of my matura exams, which means I can leave for good. Well again, even though there were times when no one wanted to meet me, I have met so many interesting people in Koszalin that I spent a huge part of my last weekend in Koszalin just saying goodbye to them and some of them kept telling me not to leave. But I left for Vienna and here I am, on the bus to Warsaw, sitting with my laptop on my lap (now you know why it's called so,) and I shall arrive in Warsaw Central at 8.55 p.m., which leaves me quite a lot of spare time to manage.

      I spent so much time thinking positively that I think now's the time to thinking of what can go *wrong*. Firstly, if I don't succeed in finding a shared apartment and end up with no place to live in Vienna, I will have no other choice than go back home. Then, if I end up with no job for the summer, there is little to no hope that I would be able to find a job for the academic year. Assuming that I passed my matura exam and my mother doesn't lose my school report before I get to the university. Then I don't necessarily have to like Vienna as a place to live, even though everyone I know says it's great and fascinating. I would go back. I'm sure going back to Koszalin after a longer absence like the one I'm planning would be nice, even if it involved another long journey like this one.

      Even if everything goes wrong: my holidays *really* started. A month and a half earlier than those of my second-grade colleagues, and lasting a month longer. I could go camping or find a nice job in Mielno. So why did I choose Vienna when 1€ costs nearly 4.40 PLN?

      To those who care about staying in touch with me: I will probably start to use Skype and I'll still be available through my current mobile number _and_ the previous T-Mobile number. Anyway, most of you are my Friends on Facebook and/or have my e-mail address. And I will be using German as my primary language, but my blog will still be in English. Cheers!

      *Edit:* It's somewhere in Bydgoszcz. I wanted to write that I will never go anywhere with a PKS bus, but I'm not so sure about it--''never say never,'' they say, meaning that you can't speak about very distant future because, as every Buddhist knows, time cannot possibly have a beginning or an end. I chose this option because when I checked the trains to Warsaw on the Net, it seemed as if there were no reasonable connections, and the bus is direct, goes _only_ 9 hours (even though a train needed 7 hours only a few years ago), and costs less. Yeah, the ticket itself might cost less, but keep in mind that you get the toilets for free on the train, while they *always* cost around 2.50 PLN at every bus station in Poland. So on longer trips the cost would be more or less the same, and you can choose to drink beer on the train without having to worry about your bladder--OK, the toilets on the train might not be the best in Europe, but they're getting better all the time and you can find water, soap and paper towels on virtually every train. In the bus I'm on there are two folks that chose to drink beer and stink sitting two rows behind me. And I can't sit with the computer on my lap as freely as I could on a train. I just know for sure that Polish transport sucks.

      I got a text message from my Polish teacher that I passed the spoken part of my matura exam in Polish, which means that if I did the essay right in the written part, I just passed my matura exam _and_ I can become a student. The thought of it is somehow not as much appealing to me as it was a year or so ago, but nothing in the world is really permanent--even a ''permanent marker'' can be removed easily with a few drops of denaturated alcohol, at least on most surfaces--so I will probably just have to accept it.

      I just realized how many times the word ''I'' has been used in the post. It's high time I finish this post.

      It's Koszalin. I was supposed to be settled in Vienna by now, but the whole thing got sucked up after a week abroad. I do not often have such difficulties with meeting new and interesting people. During my 18 days stay in the P.R.C. last summer I managed to meet quite a lot of fascinating young idealists, and a few of them were even pretty Chinese chicks. Yeah, but it was not the same in Austria. I am against most stereotypes (although I can't help agreeing with many others,) but I must admit that some Germans and Austrians are boring and stiff. I thought it might be not that bad, even though I have read quite a lot of discouraging stuff about Vienna on the Net (_o my gosh why is it such a depressive city_). On top of that, even if I could understand what all the Buddhists said to me, as they were speaking the common variant, i.e. __Hochdeutsch__, I was still helpless when trying to speak to simple people from the working class. Some Germans told me they couldn't understand the Austrian dialect, either.

      Today is Wednesday, 6th June, 2012, and that means I came back 11 days ago already--I'm not sure. Please forgive me my poor mathematic skills. I cannot count well, and I cannot count on my mother's money any more, as she told me she wouldn't pay for my living, now that I'm of age and have a lot of spare time, with which I do not do anything of use. In my opinion, the latter isn't quite true, because I am spending a vast amount of time every day on learning, meditation and exercising my earthly body at the swimming pool. And who would like to work for 6 zł an hour if the wage wouldn't even cover the additional expenses such as food and transport? Who would like to spend several hours every day in one place during each summer month? And last but not least, who would like to work at all if their mother got a new job in which she spends half of their time and insists on working in two more places, proving to be a workaholic? I think the history has already provided us with a sufficient number of examples of mad people, and I don't want to become one. It is enough that I believed everything would be easier once I graduate from high school.

      As some of you might have already noticed, today's post is the 150th. I celebrated the 50th and 100th, although I don't recall how I celebrated the 50th post and not much from the 100th, either (I mean, I only remembered something until midnight, not much afterwards.) Who wants to celebrate with me? No one? Okay, I knew that.

  - - Polish beer in Tesco. Second Spanish video
    - 151
    - ''
    - |
      If you are reading these words, there is a possibility that you ended up here after watching my "last Spanish video":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_busRacLNfc&feature=youtu.be on YouTube. It has everything to do with my ongoing Spanish mission, that is, to get some Spanish during the summer. I don't really have a plan, but I was too lazy to think of one. This video presents me talking about Polish beer in the Tesco supermarket, in the Forum shopping centre. If you came here just to read something, you can watch it below (there will be subtitles available):

      \url{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_busRacLNfc}

      There was also another video in which I was speaking Spanish in front of my laptop, but I was cheating then, because I was reading everything from the screen, and people have told me they had noticed that fact. This one was unrehearsed and only prepared in my mind, but as you can see, I forgot everything at the point I opened my mouth. I made some subtitles (maaan, was it tedious!!!) in Spanish and English. In Spanish you can notice most of my grammatical mistakes, and in English I wrote more or less what I meant.

      OK, I guess that was everything. If by some accident you're a Spanish native speaker, you can "contact":/posts/Contact me!

      And _Dear XYZ, it would be nice if you "contacted":/posts/Contact me, too. I'm afraid I won't attend any of the ceremonies you will take part in in the coming month, and since you don't have Facebook, we could lose contact forever. Just some number or e-mail address!_

    - "It's Somewhere. I've been trying to write something for the last month, but
      everything I could write would be too complicated and I would never finish the
      post. Thus, even though I would really love to produce a 10000-word-long one
      with short videos, just to make sure nobody will actually read the whole post,
      so that I could put a few strong insults directed at those with whom I was formerly
      acquainted somewhere in the last, I can't. I am limited by the small screen
      keyboard of my mobile.\n\nI spent nearly all the last week of June in Rostock,
      in northern Germany. It was really a nice time, but I have no intention whatsoever
      of writing much more.\n\nThen I went back home to prepare for this year's summer
      Buddhist course in Kuchary. The tough part was that I fell ill the day before
      leaving and I didn't have much more contact with reality while packing--I mean,
      I had even less contact with reality than usually.\n\nNow that I am writing
      these words I am in Kuchary and I'm pretty healthy, but I have to work for food
      this year. I am a member of the so-called service team, and my tasks consist
      of cleaning the lavatories, the showers and the washbasins. The job itself is
      not bad at all, but I have to get up at 6 every day, which is a bit hard when
      you go to sleep at 4 in the evening.\n\nEdit: On the train to Poznań. Here come
      the news: I have been approved as a student of Chinese studies at the Adam Mickiewicz
      University of Poznań. I didn't really have to go to the university in person
      as I could send everything by post, but I prefer it that way, because I already
      regret coming back from Kuchary. I met a young Slovak lady there that talked
      me into going to a Buddhist course in Slovakia. I feel that I just __have__
      to go there, I'm positive about it. The only problem I can encounter would be
      the money one. A friend of mine wanted me to translate her master thesis from
      Chinese into Polish for a satisfactory sum, but unfortunately I cannot get in
      touch with her now that I need her.\n\nI'm back in the non-Buddhist environment,
      but I never want to participate in samsara any more.\n \n"

    - 153
    - ''
    - |
      Ich möchte Euch eine Geschichte erzählen, aber ich kenne leider nur den Anfang. Also: ich war gestern auf der Hochzeit meines Freundes aus der Sangha. Während der Trauung habe ich schon das Mädchen, das die Eheringe reichte, bemerkt. Sie sah nicht schlecht aus. Ich fragte einen Menschen, wer das Mädchen war, und es erwies sich, dass es die Schwester des Bräutigams sei. Zwischen der Trauung und der Hochzeit gab es einige Zeit, in der die Familie des jungen Paares zu Mittag aß. Dann habe ich eine Nachricht an eine Kollegin geschickt:
      ''Mein Lama, gib mir die Willensstärke, damit ich mich nicht zu sehr besaufe und keine sehr dumme Sachen mache. Bis zur Grenze des Kotzens genügt. Und solche sehr dumme, denn normal dumme gehen schon wenn nüchtern. Es ist merkwürdig, dass ich in Kuchary nie Schwierigkeiten hatte, sich den Mädels vorzustellen, und in der Schule habe ich das in eineinhalb Jahr nicht geschafft.''

      Ich habe mich vorgestellt. Dann haben wir lange geredet. Ich habe ihr vielleicht die lustigste Geschichte dieses Lebens erzählt, die erklärt, warum ich Kung-Fu aufgegeben habe. Ich war nämlich einmal in Kuchary (vor 2 Jahren) und bin einem Mädchen begegnet, das mich von Anfang an am Arsch griff. Und dann habe ich mich schwer besoffen, denn es ist alles während der letzten Party passiert, und plötzlich hat mich dasselbe Mädchen auf den Boden fallen lassen, und ich glaube, dass sie sich auf mich setzen wollte. Zu jener Zeit habe ich noch Wing Tsun Kung-Fu getrieben, und mir blieb nichts Anderes übrig, als sie zu überwältigen und ihr den Ellbogen an den Hals zu legen. Offensichtlich war damit eigentlich keiner zufrieden. Die Kung-Fu treibenden Leute würden mir empfehlen, ich solle den Alkohol aufgeben, aber mir war viel bequemer (und günstiger), Kung-Fu aufzugeben. Das war also die Geschichte.

      Nach einiger Zeit wurde das Mädchen, mit dem ich mich unterhielt, plötzlich sehr schnell. Bilokation, d.h. die Fähigkeit, an zwei Orten in demselben Augenblick zu sein, ist mir nichts Neues. Der 16. Karmapa hat schließlich einmal dieselbe Initiation an drei Orten gegeben, oder so was. Aber das Mädchen hat offensichtlich Omnilokation beherrscht, denn sie war überall. Nie zuvor habe ich in diesem Leben so etwas gesehen. Danach ist sie verschwindet, und kurz später war die Party zu Ende. Mindestens für mich. Das Nächste, woran ich mich erinnere, war, dass mich jemand geweckt hatte und ich musste nach Hause. Es war kurz vor 6 Uhr. Und es war daran etwas Seltsames.

      Als ich jünger war, habe ich versucht, zwei Filme von Werner Herzog zu sehen. Die fand ich absolut unmöglich. Aber letztens hat mir mein Nachbar Chris den Film ''Stroszek'' gezeigt. Der erzählt die Geschichte eines Straßenmusikanten, der mit einer Prostituierten und seinem Nachbar nach Amerika fährt, um sein Glück zu finden, und findet... eigentlich nichts. Der Film endet mit einem tanzenden Hähnchen und ist zweifellos ein Meisterstück. Chris hat gesagt, der Sänger der Band ''Joy Division'' habe nach diesem Film Selbstmord begangen. Der nächste Film von Herzog, den ich nach ''Stroszek'' sah, war ''Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle''. Am Ende des Filmes erzählt der Hauptheld, Kaspar Hauser, eine Geschichte. Er kennt aber leider nur den Anfang:

      It's Poznań.

      I like to start my posts with the name of a city because it usually means that some movement has occured. In that case--I went for the final of German Language Olympics with my teacher. I can't say it was a pleasant experience yet, because I had to go with the 6.30 train, and that meant getting up at 5.30. And although I was supposed to go alone at first, which would be quite all right with me, our school principal decided he couldn't let my teacher go on her own just to watch the competition. So I had to go with my teacher. Then he decided we shouldn't go with the car. As an argument for his thesis he claimed that there were superb train connections who cover the distance in just three hours, which is faster than with a car, and much cheaper. Of course, I was more than surprised to hear it, but I was too much of a coward to make sure we were talking about the same Poznań--and the same country. I can't wait till I pass my matura exam and I can say aloud what I think of some members of the teacher staff.

      The superb train departed at 6.30 in the morning, and I had to Be in Time. My maternal grandfather had always said that there were three variants of Being in Time: coming too early, coming too late and being Just in Time. With him you could never miss a train--you would usually come way too early and still be able to spend over an hour on the station doing nothing, as if it was the train that was late. This time I manage to be Just in Time. The carriage was nearly empty, but there was a drawback--the heating was off all the way. Not that I'm afraid of low temperatures when spending time actively, but after the second hour of lying underneath a jacket that could only cover half of my body, I started to freeze.

      But I'd rather stop complaining. Hopefully my roommates are nice and outgoing. I can't stand the whole weekend without someone outgoing. I'll write later.

      to listen to some overly solemn words and be adressed \"sir\" constantly for
      two days, and there were also _some_ interesting people. Some could expect that
      everyone who makes his way to the final must learn a lot and thus be boring,
      and that girls who learn a lot are mostly ugly. Most Poles (and some Germans,
      too) claim that all the German women are disgustingly ugly. Luckily enough,
      it doesn't necessarily need to apply also to those who just speak the language.
      There were quite a few really good-lucking ones in the final. However, partly
      because of my slight degree of mastodontization, connected with the fact that
      my teacher made me spend a lot of time on formal occasions with her exclusively,
      and partly because not too many of them wanted to meet me, I only just met one
      or two (depending on whether I count the one that only punched me and said one
      word to me, lolz.)\n\nPrizes. Luckily, I didn't achieve any particular \n\nPartying.
      That's another point. For some reason it wasn't really too much fun there in
      Poznań. Everyone had a lot of money and we had virtually unlimited time, but
      on Saturday evening many people have gone to bed as early as half past midnight.
      Before I managed to went to sleep, I had to go through a part of an embarassingly
      boring party where everyone just talked to their own friends. A potentially
      great social game of \"never\" (say what you have never done and the other players
      who have done it have to drink drink) was constrained and monotonous. Some people
      asked me over and over again to tell my worst jokes, even though I only remembered
      a few that I've stolen from somewhere. No one laughed at them. There were no
      deep new friendships, no choral singing outdoors at four o'clock, but just a
      few moments of painful realization of what my cousin had once said about partying--that
      the most important factor for a good party is good companion, and the second
      most important is good music. Of course, no one enjoys spending too much time
      with people they can't stand. There is no use drinking excessive amounts of
      beer with the wrong people. There is a brilliant proverb in Polish that fits
      the situation best: __z gówna garnca nie ulepisz__ (you can't model a pot out
      of shit.)\n\nI could probably have suspected that bringing a computer connected
      to the Web to Poznań (where there is no Internet connection) would make my room
      a centre of the local social life. I had to take it to prepare the bibliography
      for my matura exam, but I only managed to write a few entries. However, as my
      presentation topic has something to do with blogging, I am going to read a few
      articles covering the said topic. It's really weird how much I can still learn
      about blogging even though I have written a blog myself for almost four years.
      For instance, I realized how much a blog has in common with a simple diary,
      even though they're essentially different in form. Most paper diaries written
      by teenagers of the past were about the same topics as the modern blogs. Żeromski,
      too, had written about girls and school in more or less the same way as we do
      it today.\n\nHow much earlier could blogs have been invented if everyone could
      write in the 14th century? And what if Leonardo da Vinci or Jesus Christ were
      bloggers? Would Christianity still get half of the medieval world under control
      or dissolve into nothingness if Saint Peter or Judas had their words saved forever
      by Google? What do you think?\n"

      The title of this post has nothing whatsoever to do with anyone. It is just a sentence that I saw written on the wall when I was going to the swimming pool. There are lots of wise sentences written on the walls in Poland (and probably in the whole world. For instance, in Gdańsk, where my brother and some other cool people live, in a subway (there are incredlibly many of them in Gdańsk,) I once saw such one: "Friends are like silent angels who lift our wings when they forgot how to fly."

      In some cities, the sentences written on the walls could even be thought of as treasures of ancient wisdom. Around the beginning of April I went to Vienna. It was long before known that I want to move to Vienna, but when I saw the place for the first time, I immediately decided to move there forever. Or at least for five years. It's not hard to understand why I like that city more than I like Koszalin. Firstly, the streets and houses in the places where I've been were all pretty and well maintained. Secondly, in Austria one can earn a lot of money. If one finds a good job--incredibly much money. Thirdly, there are bunches of foreigners there, speaking all the languages of the world, including Russian, Czech and Italian. Sometimes you can find Austrians who could speak German well enough to make it possible for everyone to understand, and once in Vienna I was sitting on the tram near a family whose members spoke both German and Russian alternately. I haven't seen many Poles, though. They must have come back to Poland for Easter.

      It's Somewhere again. I'm on the train from Koszalin to Piła, and from there I'm going to go to Warsow and then to EC, which stands for Europe Center and is a huge Buddhist centre in southern Germany. So I was at the wedding on Saturday and I tried to describe it somehow in the previous post but I apparently failed. There was the bridegoom's sister there which is almost 16 y.o. and her name is Kasia, so if I get interested in her in any way, I won't have to change the default name of all female characters in my lame stories, in case if I manage to write and finish one any more, of course. But I don't think the views for the future are that optimistic. I spent a big part of the last weeks doing the Mandala Offerings and sleeping.

      The later became a serious problem after I had come back from Kuchary, where I would only sleep a few hours before being forced to get up at 6 a.m. Now I can hardly get up at 11, and even if I hadn't drunk any alcoholic beverages the night before. I would love to write a novel, though, even if it were to be only partially finished. I have no idea what it could be about, though.

      I won't write any love stories because they're lame. I agree with the opinion that a relationship between a man and a woman should never last longer than 24 hours, although many of my friends don't.

      I won't write a travel story, except if my characters were to travel to some of the towns and villages in the vicinity of Koszalin. There are so many fascinating things you can do in Koszalin and I realize it ever more as I have finally found good places to meditate outdoors in the town and as I know many cool folks I love to spend the evenings with, wandering around the town and destroying police cars. The little villages nearby are even more interesting in the summer, and everyone knows that the best time of the year for writing novels is summer.

      I can't write a good crime story because for that you need a really good idea for the plot. But the more Swedish criminal novels I read, the more I feel the urge to put at some point a paragraph like this:

      _He could hardly resist the scream of terror when he stepped on the thick pinkish liquid he realized was human brain. Then he saw her. She was lying naked on her back in a pond of semi-coagulated blood, with one eye widely open and the other missing, apparently being the place where one of the bullets must have entered. The other ones were fired at her throat, chest and navel, respectively. Czarek ran out of the room just in time before he threw up._

      I'm not going to write SF because you need more than just a marvellous imagination for that, and I can't even imagine my life without Facebook.

      And I will definitely need to practise my written English. It's everything but fluent, and I know that I still make a lot of grammatical mistakes, most common of which being putting the wrong tenses everywhere. And I need to dedicate time to writing.

      It's somewhere and heading for Koszalin. As some of you might already know, I am a student of sinology now and I moved to Poznań. I'm going to have to cook for myself, but it's __nihil novi__, as noone really cooked for me in the past few years. The only problem that could arise is that what I cook is almost always based on fresh fruit and veggies. Okay, they might be cheap. But then there come all the other things that I definitely cannot live without: coffee, green tea, bread, jam and so on. In the end I might end up penniless and hungry, unless I get some more money.

      In the past few years I used to go busking (playing the trumpet in pedestrian areas in order to collect donations,) but I had to give it up because it was tedious and I didn't even like it too much. I was considering, for quite a while, taking it up again, but then I thought a little longer and it dawned on me how much I would have to practise in order to be able to get a few pence every other Saturday and I realized it was madness. Do I really have too few spare time activities? Wouldn't I love to meditate at least two hours every day? And am I not supposed to learn a lot? I'm pretty sure my specialization is quite demanding. It must be if so many ambitious chicks give it up every year. I think it would be a better deal if I used this one potential hour every day for learning. And I'll see how things go in practice.

      I've got a diary in which I write about random events that I consider important for the further development of this life. For instance, the party that my good friend Sochal and I consider probably the best party that we two have ever been to is called "Party at Kasia Kosidło's Place"--probably because it took place at Kasia Kosidło's. Some of you may actually know the mentioned girl, but personally, I don't. I would of course recognize her if I bumped into her in the streets of Koszalin (where else?), but she definitely wouldn't, nor would she remember what happened on 7th Oct., 2011. As for me, I would probably have long forgotten the party if not for my diary.

      Having a paper diary is in many respects much more convenient than keeping a blog. In a diary you can write anything you want. If some other person reads it, they would probably not care anyway. And if they cared, for example if the diary were to be used as evidence in a criminal case, then my diary wouldn't probably be of much use for a simple judge, because recently I write all the entries in my crude, broken Chinese. It is probably a very good way to see how my writing is changing now that I'm studying Chinese at the Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań.

      Keeping a blog is also a lot of fun, especially because now I turn my computer on very, very seldom. My laptop is covered in dust more then all the other pieces of furniture, and definitely more than my e-book reader which I use on a daily basis. That is to say, during all the lectures. I like reading books for youth, and the one I'm reading now is __Winnetou__. In German.

      Today I went to the P.E. class, which is compulsory for 1st year students at AMU. It takes place every week in a part of Poznań an hour away from where I live. I have to get on the tram on time, otherwise I miss the next one, which means in turn that I will be just one minute late for the last part of the journey, which is the bus number 98. For some funny reason, while the P.E. class for my group starts at 9.30, and I can only reach the gym by bus, it (the bus) departs at 9.02, 9.10 and 9.32.

      Today, i.e. on 19th Nov., 2012, I took the tram that would arrive to the bus stop at 9.11, and causing me to miss half of my lesson. On top of that, I didn't bring any packed lunch because I didn't make any on Sunday, the reason being my weekend visit in Koszalin.

      For some unknown reason I changed my mind when I was about to get into the second carriage. I got onto the front one. And I stood there in the back.

      And there was a human being standing there, much shorter than me, with shiny dark hair and her eyes the colour of the night sky in August in south Bavaria. I'm pretty sure that she knew about my existence, because when I sneezed, she looked at me and said the usual __Na zdrowie!__ thing. She got out of the tram two stops earlier than I did.

      My life hasn't been the same ever since.

      Social life up by 13 points. Last weekend I went to a Buddhist lecture and met two people, let's call them A. and A. Something in me made me say 'Guys, I think we'll have to exchange phone numbers. You look like you go to parties a lot.' As a result, I got two offers to go out this week. Yesterday I went to a house party where I only knew A. and A. A. got seriously drunk soon after I arrived and fell asleep on one of the numerous beds in the flat quite soon, only to end up puking half an hour later. I spent a considerable amount of time with a really gorgeous girl and got brutally rejected the following day. Today guests came to visit me from the small town back in Nebraska where I come from. I will definitely be very sleepy tomorrow, but at least I won't be able to complain about not having any companion.

      I guess I know what my next short story will be about. However, I noticed that an idea, even if it's really ingenious (and mine is rather not) may never become what it was intended to be. Let's make it into a novel stub, the way ideas for stories were written down in a book I read recently, called _The Ringmaster's Daughter_ (worth reading!):

      _Upon visiting a shop with Chinese stuff, Czarek, a young student of the first course of Sinology, finds a weird-looking stone with inscriptions in Tibetan and a likeness of bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, considered the personification of the compassion of all Buddhas in Tibetan Buddhism. One evening, while spending time together with his fellow students, Xi Danei (also known as Maciek,) Wang Chu (also known as Sandra) and Shi He (also known as Ola,) Czarek manages to decipher the mysterious inscriptions on the stone. As a result of the wishes and vows that they make through reading the inscriptions, all four students are granted the ability to transform into animals - Czarek can now morph into a Snow Lion, while Xi Danei, Wang Chu and Shi He become able to turn into a Garuda, a tiger and a dragon respectively. They decide to use their new supernatural powers to fight evil and criminals in general, as well as the Communist spies responsible for the really cold weather in March. In order to learn to control their bodies better, they all learn the profound martial art of kung-fu, as well as many other useful things._

      _Things I may want to put in the story:_

      * _a trip to Koszalin, Nebraska,_
      * _a girl - as I already decided, she would be called Kasia and would be a compilation of all the beautiful and toxic girls I encountered in this life,_
      * _maybe something else - it's 3.21 a.m. and I really feel I have to lie down._

      See you guys in the next post!

      When I was preparing my unprepared presentation for my spoken matura exam in Polish, I repeatedly burst out laughing at the stuff one guy wrote on his blog called "__Blog Humorystyczny Fiona94__":http://fiona94.blog.interia.pl/. His post were all similar in build: the guy would usually get up, go to school or not, come back home, play football, then write a blog post, then take a shower and go to sleep. There is one notion that __W szkole kapuś skuter poszedł do panie pedagog nakapować że pobiłem młodszego kolege.__ (At school that snitch Skuter told the pedagogist that I beat up a younger colleague.) and one that __Dowiedziałem się od mamy że o 17 Przyjezdrza w gości do mnie kolega. Z kolegą pierw byliśmy w parku pograliśmy chwile w piłe i wruciliśmy do domu;D. Pogadaliśmy chwile i postanowiliśmy zrobić polowanie na koty (ale były dymy). Właśnie przyszłęm do pokoju bo oglądałem tv. Teraz siedze i pisze bloga.__ (My mother told me that a friend was coming to visit me at 5 p.m. My friend and I went first to the park, we played a little football and came back home. We talked for a while and decided on a cat hunt (that was cool.) I just came to the room as I've been watching TV. Now I'm sitting and writing the blog.)

      But now that I look at my life, it seems like it's not much different from that of that poor bloke Fiona94. I could write a post everyday, saying __Today I got up too late because I was writing my blog at 3 a.m. I ate sandwiches with peanut butter, Nutella and jam. Then I went to the Uni. I read silly books for teenagers in my L1. Then I came back home and wasted the next 6 hours. Then I went to English lesson and didn't learn anything at all. Now I'm writing my blog and soon I'll go to sleep.__ And every Saturday post would begin with __Yesterday I went to a party and got completely wasted. Now I'm sore all over my body and my heart hurts because I got brutally rejected by one or another beautiful and deceitful young lady.__

      Today, however, was different. As a result of a house party I left my headphones at my friends' place. They live in a part of town called osiedle Kosmonautów, which is only a few kilometers farther then the end of the world, but I had to go and get my headphones back. The girls were even more wasted than I was, plus they had slept much less than me today. I decided not to bring any more alcohol, but instead I prepared some food for them. It's a nice way of finding companion for eating. They obviously didn't feel like anything, let alone any social interaction more sophisticated than sleeping together, but I stayed until 2 anyway. One of the girls fell asleep at a point so I spent the rest of the evening talking to the other one. She's cute and studies Bulgarian, and my brother is in Bulgaria at the moment, so it was a nice excuse to talk about languages. I wrote __колело__ on her forearm. It means __bicycle__.

      口语考试自由说话

      题目：如何学习外语才最快？

      我最近发现很多人都觉得我对一个二十岁的少年来说已经会讲太多门外国语。如果有一个人问我，我到底会说几门外语，我一般说四门：英语、德语、俄语，还有一点点中文。只不过，每个人都有自己的说法，有的说是七门，有的说至少十五门，有的说在山东，有的说在山西。他们好像羡慕我的什么“人才”，或者说我是什么“天才”，有的还称我“师傅”或者成为我的粉丝。真的？我还没想到那么多人连这一点儿常识都没有，怎么会把我这个屌丝当作师傅？原来学习外语没有什么难的。我今天的自由说话的题目就是“如何学习外语才最快？”希望以后谁也不会以为我讲这些语言是因为有什么所谓“人才”。

      在学习外语的过程中最重要的两件事就是'''态度'''和'''实践'''。而这两件事跟晚会和乌克兰都有密切的关系。我经常参加各种各样的晚会，晚会的时候有很多交新朋友的机会。因为波兹南这个城市比较大，所以这里的外国留学生特别多。大部分外国人都觉得波兰语不好学，所以这几千外国人当中可能有几百个会用波兰语交流，会说流利的波兰语的外国人更少。在我看来这对学习外语的人特别好。在波兹南留学的外国人主要分三部分：

      第一部分是'''西班牙人'''，他们一般是Erasmus的，来波兰玩，原因是波兰的俱乐部跟西方差不多好玩，但至少便宜三倍。<br />
      第二部分是'''乌克兰人'''，他们来波兰认真学习，有的比波兰学生还努力。乌克兰人因为会讲俄语和乌克兰语，所以波兰语一般学得比较快。<br />
      第三部分是学习医学的'''台湾人、挪威人'''什么的。这一部分很难看见，因为他们或者整天整夜呆在宿舍学习外科，或者在波兹南最贵的俱乐部花钱。

      你们如果能够找到几个好的外国朋友，那么好可能几个星期以后就会说一口流利的目的语言。只不过，那个“好可能”还是不够了。打个比方：我上大学以前，我真的很想学会西班牙语。现在也很想，可是我除了几句¡Joder! ¡Menuda resaca tengo! ¡Fue el puto vino de ayer!之类的日常用语，什么也说不出来。高考后，我努力学习了两个星期西班牙语，做完了全部课本，但以后没有进歩。为什么呢？就是因为我一个西班牙朋友都没有。我的德语以前比中文还流利，现在可只会说 Meine Mutter ist Computer（我的母亲是一台电脑）。为什么呢？就是因为我没有练习德语的机会。而我的俄语。。几个月以前我还以为等一会儿就会忘掉所有的俄语。到现在，我在波兹南只认识过一个俄罗斯人。恰巧在一个冬天的黑夜，我在一个酒吧碰到了一个从乌克兰来的老朋友，她还给我介绍了不少乌克兰朋友。以后，我每次出门都碰到很多乌克兰人，而每个乌克兰人都会说俄语。这样我不仅没有忘掉俄语，而且我越说越流利。要想学好一门外语，千万还要整天整夜呆在家。这不仅很无聊，而且还不如跟外国人练习。我的好有当中，波兰语最流利的、最准确的不是乌克兰人，而是日本人。他不但没有上什么波兰课，上大学的时候还每个星期都出去四五次玩。

      但这个还没有解决我以前的问题：我还是不会讲西班牙语。

      It's Piła. After over two weeks of wandering around with no apparent motive, I am finally going back to my hometown, Koszalin. I must say I felt very happy today when I got off the train and took a deep breath &mdash; the air was incredibly fresh and fragrant compared to that in Warsaw.

      On 24th August, 2014 I am goint to China for a year. In 11 days I will leave behind my ordinary Polish life and set out to find new inspirations in a metropolis called Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, known for its spicy cuisine, proximity to Tibet, scenic spots and beautiful women.

      When I got my plane ticket two months ago, I was absolutely sure I don't want to prolong my stay in Poland. I assumed I won't have anything to do here, anyway, and I'd better leave as soon as possible. The flight I'm going to take only leaves once a week; there was one on 17th, 24th and 31st August, each, but the tickets for the 17th were sold out, so I chose the 24th and prepared for two months of idleness and boredom. In the meantime, I indulged in bad eating habits, including consuming fast food and skipping meals, drank bubble tea on a regular basis (and it's insanely expensive in Poland!)

      On Tuesday, 29th July, I got on the train from Poznań to Warsaw at 1:30 p.m. with my bike. I chained it on a suitable spot and went on to look for a place to sit. I eventually chose the first row with two free places next to each other that I found. Unexpectedly, there was a really gorgeous blonde sitting opposite me. Later she said that few people can look at the boobs of a woman they just met the way I did so unembarrassedly without the woman taking him for a pathetic retard. Our conversation supposedly started when the so-called ''Woodstock Train'' &mdash; full of drunk people carrying a few dozen bottles of beer and a few ounces of hard drugs each &mdash; set out for its journey from Poznań to Kostrzyn, where Woodstock festival took place. The people on the other train were very loud. I asked her if she was going to Warsaw &mdash; and she was, which meant I was going to spend a few hours with her. I told her I was going to Warsaw to get my Chinese visa, and she had a job assessment the next day. We talked about all the usual crap people always do.

      And yet she didn't run away. The next day we met up in Gold Terraces, a shopping mall in the centre of Warsaw, known among inhabitants of the capital for bad taste and high prices. We were absolutely sure we'll never see each other again. The next time we met, she gave me a book by the Israeli writer Etgar Keret, ''Suddenly, a Knock on the Door'' (a good title, by the way.) It's a good one. One day I'll become a good writer like him; I always wanted to become one, ever since I learned to write and type at the age of six. Then again, maybe I won't, but even if I won't, I still want to write down my impressions of China and publish them here.

      <div style="text-align: center; font-weight: bold;">*  *  *</div>

      I know it's not autumn yet, it's just the middle of August. And yet I had this weird feeling today, the same I had every year when going to school. It was the restless anticipation, when I was getting tired of holidays and wanted to go to school again. Every year I was filled with enthusiasm to get up early every morning to have decent breakfast and go to school on time. Of course, after a few weeks or even days all this joy was long gone and all I was left with was compulsory education, homework I never used to do, and duties. I cannot say I have ever been a big fan of going to school, but at least I could assume that since I was already wasting time on something I didn't want to do, I could as well do something fun in this time. That's how I learned to always have a good book in my bag. I would never speak such good Chinese as I do now if I didn't practise writing and learn vocabulary items in Maths and Geography classes. The school was also a good place to meet cool people, especially girls.

      And now I'm not going to school any more. But after two years at university I am suddenly going to have to attend classes at 8 a.m. every single day. And I like green tea. I'm going to have a lot of green tea in China.

      I am somewhere between Koszalin and Poznań. The moment I realized I'm going to Poznań on the same train as most of Poznanian tourists going back home from Mielno, it was too late. On top of that, I feel extremely silly wearing a light blue Polartec jacket (everything else has been laundered and hung out to dry,) and having to pull behind me an enormous red suitcase. In exactly a week I'm leaving for China. Before I go, I have yet to settle a few matters: the letter with my debit card has not come yet, which means I wouldn't be able to use ATMs in China (I assume it's rather unlikely there's Alior Bank in Chengdu if there is none in Koszalin; I once met a 19-year-old girl from London in Odessa, Ukraine who was surprised there was no office of the Central Bank of London in Odessa&mdash;in the end, there is one on every corner in London, isn't it?<!-- it/one/there/whatever - dowiedzieć się -->) Most of my possessions are located haphazardly somewhere in Koszalin, Poznań, and between. Plus, I want to meet with the girl I met on the train for the last time before I leave.<!-- If I ever see her again, she might be married with children. -->

      <strong>2014-08-19 16:44:49 +0200</strong><br />
      It's still Poznań and I'm on the train again. I was supposed to come here again to meet the girl from the train from Poznań to Warsaw, but my plans changed and I'm not coming to Poznań until July next year.

      I wanted to say something about this city. Every time I'm going back to Poznań after any longer absence, I usually say ''I'm so happy. But I'm afraid my good mood is soon going to change, because I'm arriving in Poznań and I'll have to buy tram tickets.'' You may argue that the public transportation network in Poznań is not that bad. My answer is usually: it's not bad. It's ''tragic''.

      What's good about Poznanian transportation is that there is &ldquo;Pestka&rdquo;, that is, ''Poznański Szybki Tramwaj'' (Poznanian Fast Tram). It's actually an ordinary tram, the only difference being that it doesn't go through the crowded streets, and has its own dedicated line instead. Pestka is quite cool. In my first course I had P.E. classes at the other end of town. It took an hour's tram ride from where I lived at that time to the Morasko Campus. Getting up in winter at 6.30 on a Monday morning is bad enough, though sitting on the tram is a good time for reading books, like the ''Jeżycjada'' series by M. Musierowicz (I read 17 out of 19 episodes mostly on those foggy Mondays.) Now imagine you can't buy tickets because the vending machine is broken (Poznań is the only city in Poland where drivers don't sell tickets.) Or that a tram broke on the way of Pestka and there are ten trams queueing one after another and you have to get off and walk (which is actually not that bad, since walking is good exercise.) Or that you missed the only bus that could take you to Morasko campus and you're 20 minutes late (and so what? Who cares?)

      Tickets. I didn't spend a single minute in Poznań during the UEFA 2012 cup, but I heard from Poznanians that the cheapest reduced-fare tickets used to be 1 PLN before that memorable event. Then the city had debts and they gradually raised prices. It was 1.30 PLN/15 minutes when I moved, 1.40 PLN/15 minutes from the beginning of 2013 until recently, and now it's 1.50 PLN/10 minutes, 2.30 PLN/40 minutes, and '''nothing in between'''. This means that single tickets in Poznań are now more expensive than in Warsaw, where you pay 2.20 PLN/75 minutes, and Warsaw is way bigger anyway. The city also enforces the use of PEKA (''Poznańska Elektroniczna Karta Aglomeracyjna'', Poznanian Metropolitan Electronic Card.) If you have the card, you can pay proportionally to the number of stops you ride; in the end, it's just 0.08 PLN (0.04 PLN for reduced-fare ticket) for one stop. However, the price list is written in a very unclear way. Also, the PEKA works electronically, so it's subject to technical problems. One of my classmates transferred 10 PLN to her PEKA account&hellip; and after a week the money was still not booked&mdash;which meant she had to pay those ridiculously high prices.

      Poznań is a city that forces one to ride a bicycle&mdash;the roads are too crowded to drive, especially at rush hour, and the buses and trams are simply much slower and more stressful than a 15-minute bike ride to the city centre, or 25-minute ride virtually anywhere else.

      <strong>2014-08-19 20:47:14 +0200</strong><br />
      So I'm still here on the train and my enormous suitcase (ready for China) are right above me. Next to me there is a typical Polish family: the father is tall, muscular and bald, the mother plump and growing older with every second, and the daughter something in between, about 13 years old. Apparently they set out for an adventurous journey from somewhere in central Poland (maybe Poznań) to the seaside town of Kołobrzeg. The father seemed to be disappointed throughout the journey that there was nothing to get drunk on, and he kept talking boulderdash. He even said something about birds and platypuses and I naturally told him that platypuses are mammals. He was utterly bewildered. Just lately the whole family had an argument over nothing in particular and now the female part of the family seems to have just cried.

      My bottom is tired of sitting. My sinuses hurt a bit like they want to kill me softly, and I'm as tired as I could be.

      <strong>2014-08-20 16:14:43 +0200</strong><br />
      Today I wanted to go swimming in the swimming pool, but when I came there it turned out only the smaller one was open and that I can either wait until September or go to another city. That's exactly why I'm going to Szczecin this weekend (and since I'll already be there, I can also visit my father.)

      It's Koszalin and heading for Szczecin. I'm sitting in the corridor because some guys in my compartment have very wide legs and I can't set up my laptop when I'm sitting next to them. I'm leaving for Beijing in less than three days and things are mostly settled. I even have my debit card so that I can waste money faster.

      <strong>2014-08-24 13:35:17 +0200</strong><br />
      I'm on the train and heading for Berlin Hbf. In less than six hours I'll be boarding the plane to Beijing. At the moment I'm in a bilingual compartment, speaking both Polish and German. That reminds me of the joke about the Silesian guy who happened to be in Germany and wanted to buy a good ''ancug'', but didn't know how to say it in German.

      <strong>2014-08-25 05:32:08 +0800</strong><br />
      It's somewhere over the magnificent Ural mountains (they must make a brilliant view at daytime, unfortunately I can't see them now for the darkness) aboard an Airbus A330 and heading for Beijing (4500 km to go.) In China it's almost 6:00 in the morning; in Poland, where I come from, midnight. The lame touch screen in front of me (not upgraded at all since I last took this flight, more than three years ago, on 8th Aug., 2011) indicates that my altitude is 37000 feet above the sea level (which I take to be around 12 km, speaking in human terms.) Yesterday I was in Szczecin and I managed to meet with a friend I met two years ago during my ''Zentrale Mittelstufenprüfung'' exam (i.e. C1 in German,) but only for a while. Meanwhile, my family was watching ''Grand Budapest Hotel'' back home. I wanted to make an image of the disc to watch the movie later on, but unfortunately I couldn't (&ldquo;unable to copy encrypted DVDs&rdquo;.) Now guess what? The same movie was right in front of my nose, ready to be watched on the lame touch screen. It's a good one.

      My first encounters with ubiquitous Sinophone society are a bit surprising. First of all&mdash;my spoken Chinese must apparently have improved since my last visit in China. I remember the last time on the plane I couldn't have long, elaborate conversations with native speakers of Mandarin, nor could I comprehend their fast and colloquial speech when they were talking about the main differences between Asian and Western women (not that I'm an expert in women after all.) Actually, I remember my aural comprehension used to be so bad everything the Chinese said was reduced to meaningless, guttural grunts and a bunch of misplaced vowels. Still, although the Chinese language is rich in picturesque<!-- obrazowy --> adjectives and synonyms, I haven't found a suitable word to express the European concept of a lover (as in a partner in an extramarital affair.)

      I went to Berlin early and ended up waiting four hours at the airport with 2 &euro; in my pocket. I exchanged 40 bucks at a very bad exchange rate to fix myself a proper grub, but as a result, I ended up with euros I didn't need. My sinuses are a pain-in-the-neck and hurt badly. I wish I could come back to perfect health.

      <strong>2014-08-25 19:57:32 +0800<br />
      Day 1 in China</strong><br />
      I am somewhere above Xi'An (pronounced ''śi-an'') and heading for Chengdu. I spent part of my day trying to get around in Beijing and I must admit it didn't go as smoothly as I have anticipated. I got on the Beijing Airport Express (or 机场快轨) and arrived at the Dongzhimen station at about 1 p.m. I bought a bottle of jasmine ice tea that I love so much and tried in vain to find a bank. Then I just got on a random subway train and assumed it can't be going ''that'' far if it's just six stops. Then it turned out that these six stops to Lishuiqiao took me about 30 minutes and that I was slowly running out of time.

      I went to the bank and sold whatever US$ I had left and hurried back to the airport. In desperation, I caught a cab, because I thought I wouldn't manage to catch my flight if I were to go back to Dongzhimen and then take the Beijing Airport Express. The assistant at the bank told me that the airport was actually quite close, and it really was. The taxi driver told me the ride would probably cost about 100, maybe even 120 RMB. It was just 27 km, however, and it only cost 85 RMB (about $13.) Then it turned out that I went to the wrong terminal. Then my plane was late and I realized I could have taken the Express just as well.

      I haven't heard any Polish after departing from Tegel yesterday. The only signs of European presence were:
      * a German who was exchanging some crazy amounts of euros at the airport (I joined his transaction and saved 60 RMB on commission)
      * a Russian woman who was going to Tibet.
      * and others.<!-- Sichuanese accent -->

      <strong>Chengdu, 2014-08-26 23:59:28 +0800<br />
      Day 2 in China</strong><br />
      Today I moved to East Overseas Students Dormitory. It's the first time in my life that I live in a dormitory, and I hope the obvious inconveniences will soon be compensated with rich social life and Erasmus-grade parties. If you want my new address, please contact me on Facebook or by e-mail: dmuhafc (at) gmail (dot) com.

      After I had some sleep during the day, I began to see the city brighter colors. I met a few nice people, including two girls from Korea, one guy from Yemen, and one from Syria.

      <span style="color: #00a; font-variant: small-caps;">'''Water.'''</span> I have the feeling that the most useful Chinese character radicals (a part used to index characters in dictionaries) in Chengdu are 氵/水 (shui3 or three drops of water) and 雨 (rain.) Some of the words you can make with them include: 雨傘 yu3san3 – umbrella; 雲 yun2 – clouds; 開水 kai1shui3 — hot water;
      even my university campus is called Wangjiang 望江 &mdash &ldquo;overlooking the river&rdquo;, the river being the famous Yangzi.

      Last night I went out with a few Chinese I met at the hostel. This already showed that traveling alone may be beneficial in language practice–we spoke Chinese all the time, and I was happily surprised when they asked me if I knew the word '''高'''瑞'''大'''氣'''上'''檔次. It was a word that we learned in listening comprehension class back in Poznań, and it seemed too complicated to be useful back then. We went to eat 烤魚 kao3yu2, or baked fish. We ordered it in a small family restaurant in a street close to the hostel, brought back and ate from two common bowls (there were no real bowls so they used plastic containers for selling tiny tubes of toothpaste and bottles of shampoo from the minishop at the reception.) I think they said it was a specialty from Chongqing, and just as all Sichuanese dishes it was very spicy, really tasty (if you haven't tried it, you can never imagine its taste,) and I had to fish for edible pieces with my chopsticks, leaving behind a liquid mixture of pepper, Sichuanese pepper, chilli pepper and the like. Then some foreigners came and we ended up drinking Snow beer and playing a silly (and potentially deadly) alcoholic game of cards.

      <span style="color: #900; font-variant: small-caps;">'''– – Buying a SIM card.'''</span> I also managed to buy a Chinese SIM card. The word &ldquo;manage&rdquo; is not exaggerated at all. When I first went out shopping during the day to buy beddings (129 kuai,) green tea (16.90 kuai) and toilet paper (9.90 kuai<ref>Kuai — 塊/块 kuai4, a colloquial word for the Chinese currency, yuan. In fact, you can tell that a person doesn't speak Chinese at all if they use the word ''yuan'' in English.</ref>,) I didn't have my passport with me. Then I took the passport from the dormitory and went in the opposite direction to an outlet of China Telecom***, buying on the way shower gel (23.50 kuai,) a Chinese-style teacup (25 kuai,) tiny bananas and a ''jin'' of apples (15.50 kuai.) I was told that I can't buy a card with my passport and that I needed a Chinese ID card–which in turn required being granted Chinese citizenship, and that's something I had rather not do, because I like the freedom of wandering around in Schengen too much. So I went back to the first shop I visited and got a card of 中國聯通 (100 kuai.) My Chinese number: (+86) 185-8399-3732.

      <span style="color: #900; font-variant: small-caps;">'''– – – Dormitory Bathrooms ;('''</span> As I came to Chengdu through Confucius Institute Scholarship and I don't pay for the dorm, I was given the cheapest available room, a double room in the East Dorms. I don't mind sharing the room as long as the roommate I get is OK, but the problem is that there is no bathroom in the room and I have to use the shared ones, one for the whole floor. All toilets (or, to be precise, both) are Asian, i.e. squatting style. That is because the toilets are shared by about forty people of various nationalites on each floor You can't sit on it, and the joyous ritual of going for number two with a good book or magazine automatically ceses to exist–alas! What a loss! As a lazy foreigner, I consider this type of toilets to be debilitating. Also, similar to many other places in Asia, the sewage system is too narrow to let through toilet paper so you have to throw it into a trash bin.

      <strong>Chengdu, 2014-08-27 03:17:47 +0800<br />
      Day 3 in China</strong><br />
      <span style="color: #090; font-variant: small-caps;">'''+ + Bubble tea.'''</span> Good news for bubble tea lovers: it's really cheap in China. There are many flavors to choose from and it costs 5-8 kuai, which is quite something, compared to the prices in Poland — up to around 17 PLN, or 35 kuai. Bad news: only tapioca. So, unfortunately, for an ultimate bubble tea experience, you may have to visit Taiwan, where it originated.

      Day 4 in China</strong><br />
      Still no Internet. I went to Chunxi Road, the only shopping street in Chengdu I know by now, to look for free wifi. I headed for Häagen-Dazs first, assuming that such an exclusive place will definitely provide Internet connection. It turned out, that they didn't even have their own toilet and one had to go to public restrooms, (!) and the cheapest things I could order were ice-cream desserts for 80 kuai and more. Then I went to McDonald's and ordered a Tie Guan Yin for 19 kuai. I got Tie Guan Yin in a teabag (19 kuai!) and sat down to connect. I couldn't. I could not connect to McDonald's own network, and it turned out that I cannot connect to any website if my VPN client cannot connect to the VPN server first—and that is impossible! Most of these networks want me to log in first, so everything is redirected. Madness.

      I don't even own a travel guide, and I definitely didn't do my homework well, because I don't know what major tourist attractions there are. I will probably go and see all Buddhist temples, with emphasis on Tibetan Buddhism, and I will have to buy a good meditation cushion. I met my first Pole in the dorms today. It turned out he was going home the next day and gave me all of his stuff that he didn't need, including a metal bowl, cloth hangers, cosmetics, cutlery, and even small pegs perfect for closing that bag of tea I bought yesterday. More people I met today: an Iranian, three Germans (two of them, a pair, I met in the Overseas Students Office; I even tried to speak some German with them but it felt like opening a beer bottle with a fingernail,) and my roommate, from California. He apparently knows the city way better than I do; he took me to a shop with Western products (at Norwegian prices,) a supermarket called &ldquo;Trust&rdquo; 好又多 (hao3 you4 duo1, literally something like &ldquo;it's good and there is a lot of it&rdquo;, but it also sounds similar to 好友多 hao3you3 duo1, &ldquo;a lot of good friends&rdquo;, hence the English name,) and a small restaurant where we had fried bell peppers, gongbao chicken, and an awfully oily dish with bitter gourd (苦瓜 ku3gua1, supposedly very good for your health.)

      Day 5 in China</strong><br />
      I'm sitting in my room and eating fresh peaches, too tired to do anything more serious. Most of yesterday I spent walking around. I went to the Manjushri Temple to look for any traces of authentic Buddhism, but all that I found was just blind cult of a fat golden guy. There was a stupa, or rather a pagoda, that looked good and I could even feel some faint blessing in it, but there were signs indicating the correct direction of walking around the stupa—and if they have to tell people which way to go, it's a bit like putting signs at the entrance of a church saying &ldquo;Please do the cross thing with holy water and say the proper prayer&rdquo;.

      Close to the metro station 文殊院 Wen2shu1 Yuan4, or Manjushri Temple, there were people selling fresh fruit, so I bought fresh lychees and peaches—the lychees are so fresh their skin is soft; they're rather small, juicy and delicious, and only cost 8 kuai/jin. There are also many other fancy things to eat and drink in China. The other day I was walking near the bus stop 磨子桥 Mo4zi qiao2, and there was a shop selling freshly pressed fruit juice. I got a good cup of watermelon juice for just 10 kuai. It's not exactly ridiculously cheap, but can you imagine buying watermelon juice for 5 PLN in a city at least six times bigger than Warsaw?

      I met a group of Chinese youngsters close to Sichuan Gymnasium station and they said stuff like ''Hello! How are you doing!'' and I replied in Chinese. I only remembered them because there was a pretty girl with them (for Asian standards) who reminded me of a friend from Poznań—the only difference being the color of hair and that the one in Poznań is taller than me, and her Asian doppelgänger is shorter than 160 cm. Then I just walked away and thought I would probably never see these people again. And then, of course, I met them three hours later in People's Park (人民公园 ren2min2 gong1yuan2,) they were buying ice-cream. They invited me for a cup of tea in the park's teahouse. I told them stuff about Poland, and then one of them showed me a 100 Polish Złoty (!) note from 1988 (!!!), a note I'm too young to remember. I told them in Polish that ''Banknoty emitowane przez Narodowy Bank Polski są prawnym środkiem płatniczym w Polsce'' and they were even more surprised than when I spoke Chinese for the first time. I just hope that our serendipitous meeting was really serendipitous, and not scrupulously planned by Party officials even before I applied for a scholarship.

      I also went to Ikea with two Korean students, and bought a sofa, two wardrobes, German dark chocolate and Absolut Vodka. The most expensive items were the chocolate and the vodka.

      Things I'll probably do today:
      * nothing;
      * nothing;
      * buy drinking water (a lot) — even I don't risk drinking the tap water in China. In a supermarket it's around 5 kuai for a big bottle;
      * buy washing powder — I reckon that would be around 15 kuai;
      * get a cafeteria card, which entitles to eating meals at the cafeterias in the campus. I heard they're ''really'' cheap, and just as delicious as in the restaurants outside.

      A 同学 tong2xue2, i.e. a fellow student from Poland who is coming to Sichuan Universty, too, gave me a very positive review of my blog. ''Thanks for your helpful blog posts'', she wrote, ''without them, I wouldn't even know how much money I need for a SIM card.'' I sincerely hope that my blog posts are also helpful, and not just boring.

      Day 11 in China</strong><br />
      Last night was totally awesome. We partied so hard I almost forgot I'm not in Poland. There were nine of us: four Poles, two Brits, one Dutch, one Slovak, and one Austrian. We decided to go and eat ''huoguo'' first (火锅, known to the foreigners as hot pot.) I asked the woman at the reception about good places to eat ''huoguo'' in the vicinity, and she wrote us two place names, one of them called 胖妈火锅 (Pang4ma1 huo3guo3, &ldquo;Fat Mama's Hot Pot&rdquo;!) We headed for Jiuyanqiao, the party and food area close to our dorms. They had ''ganguo'' (干锅) pretty much everywhere, but we didn't see the hot pot anywhere, so I asked an elderly woman if they had any in their restaurant.<br />
      &ldquo;Of course!,&rdquo; she shouted. &ldquo;We have everything!&rdquo;<br />
      I was still a bit skeptic, but we sat down and ordered a few dishes.<br />
      &ldquo;So, we want to eat ''huoguo'',&rdquo; I said.<br />
      &ldquo;I'm sorry, but we don't have any ''huoguo'' here.&rdquo;<br />
      &ldquo;Have you got ''gongbao'' chicken?&rdquo; (宫保鸡丁 gong1bao3ji1ding1)<br />
      &ldquo;No, but we have everything else.&rdquo;<br />
      In the end, we ate 烤鱼 kao3yu2, roasted fish that I ordered in the 麻辣 ma2la4 variant, which is more or less as spicy as you can get.

      Day 16 in China, listening to the album ''Magical Mystery Tour'' by The Beatles</strong><br />
      From a purely samsaric point of view, life in China and, more specifically, in Chengdu, has many things to offer to an open-minded foreigner. It is said to be relatively easy to find a job, and even if it's just a part-time language teaching job, it's usually enough to make a living. For a simple Polish boy on Confucius Institute Scholarship like me, it's certainly enjoyable. You can choose from a wide variety of Sichuanese dishes or eat at Muslim noodle restaurants for just around 12 kuai (and their noodles, 拉面 la1mian4 and 拌面 ban3mian4 really taste great, and they don't serve pork.) Then you can go to a bar and get a few free bottles of Tsingtao Beer or, if you are ready to spend some more, you can go to a club and take a table for 10 persons for up to 3000 kuai, and you will be served extravagant fruit salads with sculptures made of pineapples and grenades (as papayas and oranges are not very common in this area.) You can organize a picnic for 19 people on the roof of your dorms, (it was the best!) then go on a tour around bars, or try in vain to get drunk with Chinese people. A few days ago I drank tequila (龙舌兰 long2she2lan2) for the first time in this life. I pretty much enjoy living in a real metropolis after 18 years in Koszalin and 2 in Poznań (although I still think that ''Poznań miasto doznań'' is everything but exaggerated.) In Chengdu you can ride the metro for 40 minutes and get off at a random station 30 km from where you got on, and the landscape will be more or less the same (apparently, in Chengdu the main difference is that in farther parts of the city, the buildings only have five or so storeys<!-- *** -->, while downtown they have usually twenty to thirty.)

      What bugs me is that I went to China to learn Chinese, at least in theory, and I ended up in a group called 高三, or Advanced 3, which only has classes three days a week. It's the least classes I've had on any level of education, including early grades of elementary school. I already know very well that I'm not going to use my spare time to study extra or in advance, I'd much more probably end up indulging in what the Chinese call 花天酒地的生活 hua1tian1-jiu3di4 de sheng1huo2, literally ''spend-sky-alcohol-earth life'', which is perfectly logical: you spend cash in amounts that go up to the sky, then the alcohol brings you back to earth. There is one guy in our dorms, a living legend, who supposedly spend 4000 kuai in a week, and he claims he doesn't even remember how he did it.

      I have a habit that I developed about a year of ''spend-sky-alcohol-earth life'' ago. Every time I go out, I usually have in my backpack a toothbrush and toothpaste. I am particularly pedantic about brushing my teeth in everyday life, and in case I randomly don't get home in more than 30 hours, I can always brush my teeth in any public bathroom, at the university or at a friend's place. My father even took this habit a step further when he was around my age: he told me he had used to carry around a spare T-shirt and a pair of underpants. I will definitely miss randomly sleeping at friends' places in Poznań; I'm not so likely going to end up watching ''Titanic'' until 5 a.m. here in Chengdu. So today I was out and felt the need to brush my teeth. I went to the supermarket at Yangguang Plaza and got myself a toothbrush and toothpaste for around 13 kuai. I didn't feel like taking risks too much, so I went for Colgate (called 高路洁 Gao1lu4jie2,) I chose the green variant of the one with cooling crystals. And guess what? It's green tea-flavored. I wonder if the blue variant is blue tea-flavored.

      My roommate hasn't showed up for the last week.<!-- check spelling: picknicking, storey -->

      <strong>Chengdu, 2014-09-02 01:48:27 +0800<br />
      Day 9 in China</strong><br />
      I spent the day after tomorrow mostly lying in bed, sleeping in and coming back to health, but yesterday (Sunday) was much more interesting. For most of the day I was hanging out with a multi-national group consisting of one girl from England, one from Slovakia, and one guy from the Netherlands, whose name is so uncommon that he doesn't even mind pronouncing it wrongly. In the end, it looks like I came to China to learn Chinese, but I ended up thinking in English, socializing in English, and writing a blog in English. It could still count as foreign language practice, of course, but at some point I also hope to find some Chinese friends that I can actually understand not just on the level of words, but also mentality. I'm still not accustomed to two things: the way they determine who pays the bill at restaurants; and their personal space, which seems similar to that of the Spanish-speaking or Arab cultures.

      On Sunday morning, one of the Chinese guys I met in People's Park last Thursday called me and said he was coming to my dorms to visit me. I was actually still asleep, but I could just say OK. After some time, two Chinese guys came and I introduced them to the English and Slovak girls. For the Chinese, most Western women are flawless heavenly beauties, so with whatever broken English they could come up with, they tried to get to know more about the ''biutifur girls'', and were totally disappointed when they learned that they both had boyfriends. They were also very curious to see our dorms, and they found them great. We went for something along the lines of a breakfast at a small restaurant close to the Small North Gate (小北门 Xiao3 Bei3 Men2; it's actually so small you have to shrink*** to walk through it,) and the one of the guys went and paid the bill even before the other Chinese guy could notice it. Then they forced me to let them buy me drinks (but I actually managed to give the shop assistant a 20-rmb bill before they found change in their wallets.)

      When you climb the stairs up to the last floor of the dorms, you'll find a door that leads to a spacious terrace with a view so typical for China: skyscrapers, skyscrapers, skyscrapers everywhere. During the day it can seem a bit overwhelming, but at night it seems to be a great place to drink beer outdoors. (In China, drinking alcohol outdoors is not forbidden, in some cities you can even drink ''baijiu''<ref>白酒 bai2jiu3 &mdash; a sort of Chinese hard liquor whose three main characteristics are: ridiculously low price&mdash;you can get a 2 liter bottle and still be able to afford a several beers in a bar, lethal amounts of alcohol&mdash;the standard is around 45%, 55% is also common, but it can go as high as 70%, and awful taste, so terrible it can make you throw up even if the alcohol doesn't.</ref> in public transportation.

      <strong>2014-09-03 00:32:18 +0800<br />
      Day 10 in China</strong><br />
      More and more people are coming. Koreans seem to be the most numerous*** nationality, followed by Americans. I feel the urge to improve my Korean, which is limited to just a few basic sentences, like &ldquo;What is this? This is a chair.&rdquo; and &ldquo;My hovercraft is full of eels&rdquo;. Today, while wandering around, I met three more girls from Poland, most of them called Zuza, one pretty Nepali***, and even Russians, who came here for their Master programs and were told to live at the other campus, 华西 Hua2xi1. I was particularly looking forward to meet one of the Poles, because she gave me a very positive review of my blog. She turned out to be as tall as me (not that I'm very tall, but you don't see many girls above 160-something here in Chengdu,) and vegetarian, and she's only just graduated from high school. Many others came, too, probably because the orientation and placement test is going to take place tomorrow. Everyone has to walk the same way: getting an account in ICBC, registration at the Overseas Student Office, buying everyday things, and so on. Those who don't feel confident enough with their spoken Chinese may have a tough time, since in most places in Chengdu, no one can speak good English. Soon I will also have to go through all the paperwork connected with getting a residence permit, and I heard it can take long hours and costs 400 kuai.

      I went to a place called The Spot, because one Chinese friend invited me to a Valentine's Day party&mdash;which was a bit surprising, even if you take into account the fact that the Chinese Singles' Day is also the Independence Day in Poland. It then turned out that it was just because it was the birthday of a German called Valentin, which I also met at the airport. The Spot is located close to the South Gate of the Sichuan University, and it was so foreign that the waiter didn't even speak Chinese. Another waiter looked so Slavic I thought she could be Polish, and she of course turned out to be Russian, but grown up in the vicinity of Jerusalem. In general, it's a pretty pleasant place (they even have a Western toilet, something you don't get to see very often in Chengdu,) but the super high prices don't make it a good place to just go and get drunk, even if you get 20% discount with the VIP card. Long Island Iced Tea (called 长岛冰茶 chang2dao3 bing1cha2 in Chinese) costs 68 kuai there, and in Wow on Thursdays it's just 10 kuai. That could make a difference.

      We went to Ikea for the second time today, this time in a group of four. I didn't buy anything this time, but I went to Decathlon (迪卡侬 Di2ka3nong2) and bought a foam mat for sitting on the roof. There were even 175-gram frisbees for around 39 kuai, which seemed tempting, but I'll probably wait with buying one until I get some money from the uni. I still don't have a meditation cushion, which is a pain-in-the-neck (or, more specifically, pain-in-the-back-and-legs,) and I was so busy recently, living the fake-rich overseas student lifestyle, that I even forgot to enquire on the Web if I can get one somewhere in Asia or if I should rather make one myself (should I ever manage to get buckwheat shells in a country where you cannot even get proper wheat flour,) or import one from Europe. I also convinced R., the English friend, to buy a picnic blanket, and it even came in handy when we ate mangoes and apples on the corridor floor.

      Day 26 in China</strong><br />
      A few days ago, Ricky, an Austrian-Australian friend from the dorms, came back from school and told a story:

      'So we were playing Pokémon and that guy got a Charizard and named it Red John.' He said.

      The guy he was talking to burst out laughing.

      'What does this Red John mean?' I asked. 'Does it have any hidden meaning? Like a part of a man's genitalia or something?'

      'No,' he said. 'It means taking a girl's virginity. You see, there is an American guy in the dorms who took a girl's virginity during his first week in China, and now everyone keeps calling him Red John.'

      'Oh, I see.'
      <!--
      幾天以前，一個奧地利/奧大利亞朋友回到宿舍以後，給我們講了一個故事：

      “今天我們玩口袋妖怪。一個朋友
      -->
      It was a bit funny to hear that, because the previous day I bought a bicycle. It is brand-new, as opposed to the bikes from the black market, euphemistically called ''second-hand bicycles'' here (第二手自行車 di4 er4 shou3 zi4xing2che1.) It's probably the best bicycle I've had in my life, and I'm pretty sure I could never buy such a good bicycle for that price in Poland. It's as quiet as a hobbit; shines bright like a diamond, and, most important, it's red. Choosing a name for my bicycle couldn't have been easier. The next day I simply took a marker and wrote on it it's new name in both English and Chinese: ''Red John'' and 紅色的約翰.

      For the last few days, I've felt just like on a skiing holiday, except that instead of skiing, I was cycling. Every time I went skiing, it was always just for a few days. Every day I would get up when I wanted, have breakfast, and go skiing as soon as possible. Then I would ski for as long as I wanted, go back to the hotel, and sometimes I could also go to the sauna or swimming pool, to make the day even more pleasant. Then, every day I could have a huge dinner without having to feel guilty for the calories, as I had already burnt so many of them. Lastly, during some of the trips I could also happily drink a few beers with friends and talk about life and stuff.

      <strong>2014-09-25 01:30:55 +0800<br />
      Day 32 in China</strong><br />
      I've had mood swings over the last weeks, a phenomenon that I never really experienced so strong in my life. There are moments when I am more or less satisfied with a student's life in southwest China, Sichuanese food, cycling around, and the multilingual community of expats in Chengdu. And there are days when from the moment when I get up, I am angry, sad, and sleepy at the same time. Maybe it has something to do with a change of diet.

      Sichuan University sucks when it comes to teaching Chinese to advanced students. I have five classes every week. One subject is called 綜合高級漢語, or something along the lines of &ldquo;Comprehensive Advanced Chinese&rdquo;, with a good teacher, but all we do is just talk about words and their uses. Then there's 現代漢語語法 or Modern Chinese Grammar, which is more or less the same thing we call in Poland descriptive grammar. The teacher of this subject requires the students to interact, asks them questions and tells them to read something out loud from time to time. This would be cool if the classes didn't take place so early every morning. I have something like a prolonged jet-lag that gets worse and worse with every day. It's nothing unusual if I fall asleep at 3 a.m., and I have to get up shortly after seven if I want to get something to eat before school. So, of course, I fall asleep during the classes. And the grammar teacher says things like &ldquo;Ha, ha, Moroz still didn't wake up&rdquo;. There was one optional course I wanted to take, Translations, but the classes were cancelled. The first time I attended that class, there were about 6 people in the group, including one Italian, one Californian, some Koreans (there are Koreans everywhere) and me. The teacher even told us to buy a textbook, which I obviously didn't do. The second time there was just one long-legged blonde with curly hair from Ukraine. The teacher made the impression that she didn't want to be where she was, leaving the classroom for fifteen minutes at a time, and in the end she came and said that the class was cancelled and we have to find something else if we want to get credits for optional courses. I am a lazy bastard with a Confucius Institute Scholarship, and I don't need any credits.

      The next thing: the exam in Modern Chinese Grammar is on December, 29th. Which means that if I want to prepare for it at all, I won't be able to have any Christmas fun (and a part of my family was planning to visit me in China.)

      <strong>在去重慶的火車上，2014-10-08 15:54:59 +0800<br />
      在中國第45天</strong><br />
      昨天是我到成都以來第一次出城旅遊。在成都，有時我會覺得無聊，有時甚至會感到悲傷。但幾天以前我跟兩個中國女孩去酒吧玩時，在7-Eleven（我們宿舍附近的一家24小時營業商店，在很多人的心目中是我們宿舍附近最佳酒吧之一）門前認識了一個畢業於哈佛大學中文系的美國人，我們四個人決定去蘭桂坊的一家酒吧看我朋友的表演。一路上，我們還認識了一個來自尼日利亞的朋友，然後我們五個人一起去了酒吧。

      只不過我那些侶伴們好像不清楚自己到底想去什麼地方似的。我們剛到酒吧不久，那個美國人說“不好意思，我得走了，我想到外面去買大麻。”然後，那個尼日利亞人說“好的，表演雖然是挺好的，但是我還要去另外一家酒吧看我的朋友。”終於，只剩下我和那兩個中國女孩，不久她們也走了。但是，沒幾分鐘我們五個人又聚在一起，搭計程車去了水母酒吧，這是一個在成都很受歡迎的地方。那個晚上，我們在一個半小時之內，一共搭了6次計程車，最後3次的消費是我付。（真好中國的計程車沒有波蘭那麼貴；如果是在德國的話，我兩個星期就連吃飯的錢都沒有）。

      我們那個晚上去了兩趟水母酒吧，第二次去的時候，我在那兒看見了兩個看上去很像俄羅斯人的女孩，就問：“請問，妳們會說俄語嗎？”<br />
      “會啊！”一個女孩回答。“我們是俄羅斯人。”<br />
      “我恰巧也會說俄語，認識妳們很高興。”<br />
      我們那個晚上玩得很嗨，第二天我15點才起牀。

      昨天我去那兩個俄羅斯人住的地方，一個叫“街子古鎮”的小城市。跟很多所謂古鎮一樣，它大部分樓房是2008年才建成的。我那一天約了那個俄羅斯美女在街子見面，但是她的手機一直都關機。因此，我就一個人去爬山。首先我不太願意去“古鎮”附近的一座寺廟，正因爲它叫“古寺”。我就認爲，如果那座寺廟跟古鎮其它建築都一樣古老，我就不用看。但是去“古寺”的道路叫做“康道”，是山坡的一條小路，我覺得應該值得走。我以後才知道，那條“康道”大概長10多公里，而那座“古寺”真的很古老，而且美麗極了。一路上我還認識了一家跟我一樣去爬山的中國人，他們跟我打招呼的話就是“小子！吃蘋果！”可見很多人都知道我喜歡吃東西。我跟那家人一起爬到了那座“古寺”，然後我終於成功地跟那個俄羅斯美女見了面。

      今天我坐火車去重慶旅遊。很多人都抱怨中國火車的硬座特別不方便，但其實我覺得這種座位就很像波蘭幾年之前的二等座。現在人還不算多，當然在人比較多的時候，比如說剛過的國慶節或是春節，人多得誰也過不去，甚至地上也有人睡覺、車廂裏還可以抽煙。很多人最討厭的就是硬座的那些座位，但是他們又跟波蘭火車的座位差不多一樣，而且我正在坐的去重慶的這次列車也是一樣。我以後還打算坐火車去西安、昆明等城市。

      我們宿舍的一個半奧地利半澳大利亞半荷蘭人，Ricky，一個多星期之前買了一輛三輪車，跟兩個好友一起去阿壩州，四川的一個景區。我很羨慕他，他們這個主意不僅很瘋狂，而且準備得也有點好笑：Ricky因爲沒有睡袋，所以帶一套被子去山上。

      <strong>2014-10-11 01:05:20 +0800<br />
      在中國第48天</strong><br />
      昨天我給我們大學的留學生辦公室打電話，因爲我忘了到辦公室簽字（如果不簽字就不能收到本月的獎學金）。一個中年男人接電話，我告訴他，我現在無法到留學生辦公室，因爲我在重慶。他對我的問題使我大吃一驚：<br />
      “誰同意你去重慶？”<br />
      其實，當時我覺得很不公平，因爲在波蘭誰都不在意我休閒時幹什麼，我只好來辯解說：“哦，我是高三班的，我們班星期四、星期五都不上課。”<br />
      “但這個還不是周末，你如果要星期四去旅遊，一定要向老師請假。”<br />
      我早就知道中國不算是一個重視自由的國家。我母親看見成都的照片之後說，這個成都有點兒像社會主義寫實主義的畫兒，只是綠化好一點兒。但是我來重慶才知道，原來成都很像歐洲的城市。而重慶比較像我很心儀的八九十年代的城市，在這裏甚至有贊美社會主義的橫幅。

      我發現重慶與成都有很大的區別，就是在成都交朋友特別容易，只要在九眼橋那邊走過去，就會有人請你喝酒，大聲喊：“外國人！來，跟我們喝酒！”<br />
      但是在這裏，一般來說人就不在意我是誰，如果我在酒吧跟他們打招呼，他們會問：“啊？請問你有什麼事？”<br />
      在重慶第一天，我在解放碑附近的一家俱樂部認識了兩個俄羅斯美女（真的美極了），一個在這裏已經呆了四年，當中俄翻譯，另外一個在這裏才一年半，在俱樂部跳舞。那個跳舞的女孩說，其實我不必學習得太認真，因爲在這個世界上高等教育不算是什麼，與其努力讀書，還不如在中國當英語老師或者模特兒好，因爲這樣才可以掙很多錢。她說，在晚會也可以學好中文，就是要跟中國人說話。<br />
      我發現在中國這樣的人實在很多。因爲我們波蘭的經濟情況也不是特別好，一般的碩士有時候也找不到好工作，但是在中國沒有什麼文憑也可以當英文老師。這種工作很能掙錢，每小時至少150元，有經驗的老師甚至200多元。有的人覺得，如果有文憑也找不到工作，上大學還有意義嗎？但其實，你可以在中國當幾年英文老師，然後呢？你20歲的時候可以當模特兒，30歲的時候呢？這幾年以後，你一點工作經驗都沒有，而且不再能當模特兒。

      這個國家的最大的問題大概是，這裏的人太重視金錢，完全忘了其它。

      Day 59 in China</strong><br />
      I'm at the airport in Chengdu and wanted to use the hour and something that I've left to write a few pieces of advice for travellers to China. That's mostly because my mother and brother are coming over for Christmas. My mother asked me to list all the items required to get a visa for PRC, but I thought that maybe a practical phrasebook might also come in handy. The Chinese version is given in Traditional characters, i.e. the ones not used in China anymore. I also gave the official Pinyin transcription, as well as a DIY transcription for Polish speakers.

      On the plane to Kunming I was served a butter-flavored cake (which didn't resemble either butter or cake) and <em>mala</em>-flavored goose meat (which was actually quite good.)

      Day 64 in China</strong><br />
      I'm back from Kunming. I didn't want to go back to Chengdu after such a pleasant time, but my so-called university may really start to miss me if I skip too many classes (as if I've skipped few until now.) This trip shows that it is still possible to fly cheaply in China, and not necessarily with Ryanair's level of service. The return ticket Chengdu-Kunming cost 709 rmb. I could probably have got it cheaper, but I booked it just a week before departure.

      Kunming is simply beautiful in spite of (or, for people like me, because of) all the dilapidated buildings. The city is located in the mountains, and even though it's quite big even for Chinese standards, it's the only Chinese city I've been to where you can see the blue sky, white clouds and yellow sun virtually every day. It is also famous for it's mild climate. They say that in Kunming all four seasons are just like spring (四季如春 si4ji4-ru2chun1.) When people asked me what exactly I'm going to do in Yunnan, I told everyone &ldquo;Oh, I'm going to drink the world-famous Yunnan Pu'er Tea.&rdquo; I was, of course joking, because I actually had no idea what one can do in Kunming. I seldom plan my trips before I go, a habit I could probably change in China.

      The problem with not planning longer trips in China is that the country is so painfully big. Many attractions listed on the Web, especially for bigger cities, are not located in the cities itself, but in either the suburbs or even farther. The Great Wall, a must-see attraction for Beijing, is actually three hours by coach from the city. So even in Kunming itself, if some place looks close on the map, it can be as far as two hours by bus. Then again, the only search engine for bus routes working in China is Baidu, a Chinese product that overtook the market thanks to the Chinese government's ban on Google. The company's motto is 百度一下，你就知道, which translates roughly as &ldquo;100-degree it for a while and you'll know,&rdquo; but from what I've noticed until now, googleing (or, to be more precise, baiduing) any important information with Baidu is like asking a three-year-old boy who only speaks Kurdish about the best places to eat Beijing roast duck in Warsaw. Add to that the fact that the buses traditionally don't have a schedule as such. What you find at the bus stop is usually a set of plates with the bus number, all the stops listed in the vertical align, exclusively in Chinese, and the hour when the first and last bus leave. What happens between these times, only heavens know. So if Baidu claims that the trip will last roughly 3 hours, you may be pretty sure you won't be back home before dark.

      On my way to Daguan Park yesterday, I found two places offering interesting plants. The first one was a wild bush of cannabis. The second one was a shop selling 雲南普洱茶&mdash;i.e., Yunnan Pu'er Tea. I got more than 700g for 80 rmb, and the people in the shop invited me to sit together with them and savor the delicious pu'er.

      <strong>Chengdu, 2014-11-14 01:31:06 +0800<br />
      Day 82 in China</strong><br />
      After the number of days visible in the line above that I spent in China, I got accustomed to the life in Asia and developed a certain daily routine that I unwillingly follow. The bad thing about my lifestyle is that I never fall asleep before midnight and rarely before 2 a.m. There is nothing I would love more (except maybe a new Xperia Z2 or the Korean next door girl) than to go back to the healthy sleeping habits from the happy years in Poznań, when 1 a.m. was already very late for weekdays, but my body just refuses to do it. Going to sleep that late, I never have time to get proper breakfast before classes (if I manage to go to classes at all,) so I usually have to do with nothing, a fruit or a 餅子&mdash;spicy meat cake. This way the only things I can think of in class are hunger, drowsiness and piercing cold, as there is no warming anywhere in Chengdu.

      Until recently, when my bicycle dissolved into thin air after 50 days I had the honor to spend happily with him, I would also cycle around for considerable distances. (Just to remind you: my last bike's name was Red John or 紅色的約翰.) This was a good way to get some fresh air, get to know the geography of Chengdu better (進一步瞭解成都的地理) and burn some of my excessive abdominal fat. I also practise yoga, and it's very good for more or less everything. And I spend shitloads of time in the library studying Korean. Over the last few years I've already become a sort of polyglot, but when someone asks me if there's a genius or any secret behind my polyglossia, I always say: &ldquo;The best way to become a polyglot is to learn many languages.&rdquo;

      The joy and satisfaction of making fast progress in a new language is something really hard to describe, but really, few things can compare. You can try to fall in love, but what if your crush doesn't like you as much as you do? You can smoke pot, but it's getting more and more expensive, and it can also complicate everyday life. You can practise Buddhism and it can give you happiness, but I do it anyway. But if you learn a new language, you get to feel exceedingly happy with every succesful conversation, especially if you only just started to learn the language. And what if you get bored? No problem, you just take on another language. Seriously, I really love studying languages.

      Koreans put a lot of effort into making their language as complicated and illogical as possible, but this very fact makes it so satisfying to learn. When you meet a Korean person, they will always ask you about your name, where you come from, and your age. They need your name, because in Korean (just like Japanese) it's very uncommon to use the word &ldquo;you.&rdquo; I once walked with a Japanese friend from the dorms, and we noticed another Japanese person.<br />
      &rdquo;Blimey, I forgot his name,&rdquo; she said.<br />
      &ldquo;Can't you just say ''anata'' (you)?&rdquo; I asked.<br />
      &ldquo;No, you can't. In Japanese you always have to address a person by his or her full name.&rdquo;

      With age, it gets even more complicated. If you are younger than someone, they will say: &ldquo;Oh, so I'm your 오빠 ''oppa'' (if you are female and the other person is male)/언니 ''onni'' (if you are both female)/누나 ''nuna'' (if you are male and the other person female)/형 ''hyeong'' (if you are both male.) If you are older than your interlocutor, you say the aforementioned phrase. If you are the same age, you are 친구 ''chingu'' (friend). The younger person then adopts the formal speech level, which in practice means mostly using different personal pronouns and adding the syllable 요 ''yo'' at the end of the sentence.

      Day 83 in China</strong><br />
      Some time ago, I met two Korean girls from my dorms who have a most curious habit: they go to the university library every day around 1 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m., studying Chinese even harder than I do Korean. They also have cool names: one is called Chen Protects Ideals and the other one Nan Pillar Courtyard (if you translate the Chinese characters for their names.) I haven't seen such perseverance in any non-Chinese person before. I sometimes ask Protects Ideals to check my grammar, and I correct her Chinese characters if I see any mistakes. One day I wrote a message for her on a piece of paper: &ldquo;저녁을 어디서 먹을 거야?&rdquo; (Where are you going for dinner?) She wrote: &ldquo;우리 저녁 싸왔어 &mdash; 고구마. 우리 다이어트 중 이야.&rdquo; (We brought dinner with us, sweet potato. We're on a diet.) I cast a glance at her. She's 160-something cm tall and just as fat as most Asians (not at all.) &ldquo;좋아. 나도 아주 뚱뚱해.&rdquo; (OK. I'm very fat, too.) The girls also exercise every day. Stay in the library for 7 hours with just sweet potatoes and sometimes a hard-boiled egg! That really is something!

      <strong>2014-11-16 23:38:29 +0800<br />
      Day 84 in China</strong><br />
      Yesterday I went for that magical one beer to the 24/7 supermarket 7-Eleven with Adrian. We met two Japanese friends and drank some Kirin and Asahi&mdash;local Chinese beer is even worse than Lech Premium, and yes, there is something worse in the world than Lech Premium! After the first one I said &ldquo;OK, guys, I'm going to Wow to find some Korean girl.&rdquo; My competitive advantage over most of the boring Americans going to Wow is that they only want to get some free beers (half water, half soda) and then potentially some Happy Time with the ubiquitous Sichuanese beauties, and I only wanted to practise my spoken Korean. I soon went to Wow, even though Adrian insisted that I stay for one more. I sat next to a girl who looked familiar and tried talking to her in Korean, but it was very hard&hellip; at least for the first few minutes. She was sitting with a French girl I already knew, and it soon turned out that the French girl also spoke some Korean. When I finished my second Asahi (brought into the bar from 7-Eleven,) I relaxed a bit and bought the girls some Bailey's. I was surprised at this sign of my generosity, considering that the bar I frequent most is actually 7-Eleven. The Korean girl first managed to cut her thumb really badly, ''and then'' she also broke a glass full of Bailey's. She could hardly type her native language on my dumbphone, and her asymmetrically long fingernails didn't make it any easier. I actually spoke Korean for most of the evening. The girl got a bit dizzy by 3 a.m. and still wanted to get some soju, but when we guided her to her room and her Thai roommate named Cookie helped her get inside, she didn't want to drink any more.

      Can I actually write about a routine if there is so much happening that my mind wants to explode? The main problem with the Korean girl is that she was a bit too hot, and I was thinking of her most of the day. My mind was a Koreanized mess when I rode my new bicycle to have dinner with Adrian, when I did yoga in the ping-pong room, and only cleared up a bit after a decent 8th Karmapa meditation.

      I want to go to Korea so much, and yet Korea doesn't seem to want be longing for me so much. The main reason I cannot go there for the 6 weeks of our winter holidays is money. No matter if I fly from Chengdu or from any other Chinese city, the whole journey will cost around 1500 RMB (one way,) and probably around 6000 RMB more for my stay in Korea. I could probably also go back to Poland. The ticket will of course be much more expensive, but I don't think staying and going back and forth from one Polish city to another cannot be that expensive altogether.

      <strong>2014-11-18 13:29:50 +0800<br />
      Day 86 in China</strong><br />
      My first bicycle in China, called Red John, was stolen after 50 days of riding. But the one I got two days ago (a shiny silver Giant named 은색 바람 or Silver Wind, although I was also thinking of calling it 바람의 색, The Color of the Wind) was stolen yesterday, together with the unbreakable German lock by ABUS that cost more than most bicycles in this country, from the bicycle parking in front of our university library. My biggest fault was definitely that this bicycle just looked way too good. But then again, what's the point of stealing a beautiful bicycle? Will people buy it if they know that it will be stolen again? I mean, Chinese people know best what it feels like to lose a bicycle to an uncaring thief. Actually, most people I met in China mentioned that they've had several bicycles stolen. Some people on the Web even say that some unauthorized resellers of the so-called &ldquo;second-hand bikes&rdquo; even go as far as to follow the unlucky buyer to steal the bicycle once again. Judging from what I've seen in China, I must admit this is by no means impossible.

      But then again, all I wanted was just a good bicycle to cycle around on town, why cannot I just have a shiny and fast bicycle in a country full of shiny and fast Buicks, BMWs, Chevrolets and the like?

      No i moją odmienność diabli wzięli. Dziś nie poszedłem do szkoły. Problem w tym, że dziś w ogóle nie ma lekcji, przynajmniej w szkołach publicznych (na na na na na na, ha ha ha ha ha ha, jak to mawiał Cartman). Jeszcze nie założyłem kibucu ani nawet nie przyszła deska, ale jestem dosyć dobrej myśli. Siedzę na szpetnej wersalce pośród jeszcze bardziej szpetnych paneli podłogowych, które zostawili po sobie poprzedni właściciele mieszkania i nie raczyli posprzątać. Opracowuję sobie listę koniecznie potrzebnych rzeczy, które koniecznie '''muszę''' kupić, jak znowu załatwię trochę kaski, tak, powiedzmy, ze 150 zyli. Czyli pewnie niedługo, bo nawet po zapłaceniu za deskę z wysyłką zostaje jeszcze 16 zyli + co najmniej 3 w drobniakach, więc jeszcze do licha i trochę wyjazdów weekendowych do Mielna. A jak będę miał na czym jeździć, to zaoszczędzę też trochę czasu. Siedzę więc i moczę nogi, co jest ważnym elementem przystosowania skóry stopy do obciążeń i urazów, jakich może doznać przy jeździe na deskorolce (co nie zmienia faktu, że zostało toto wynalezione przez surferów, i przez wiele lat większość prawdziwych i nieprawdziwych sk8'ów wolała jeździć boso, ba, były nawet triki dla bosych, wymagające dostępu do palców u nóg; a ja tu się zastanawiałem, czy tak się da).

      Wkrótce pewnie pójdę po wkład do filtra, bo się zużył teoretycznie już koło soboty, ale prawie na pewno ten miesiąc to tak jest na wyrost trochę wyznaczony. Wszedłem na stronę Jyska, ale nie ma tam porządnego katalogu, więc ze zniecierpliwienia wlazłem na ikea.pl. Szukam jakiejś maluczkiej, podróżnej poduszki - miałem kiedyś taką fajną, małą, niebieską, ale nie wiem, co z nią - to było dawno, dawno temu, kiedy jeszcze jeździłem na obozy, co nie zmienia faktu, że ona wtedy była chyba z Jyska; mam też jyskowski ręcznik, też niebieski, bardzo dobrze wyciera, lubię go, ale przecież ma już ze trzy lata więc przydałaby się jakaś odmiana. Mógłbym też załatwić sobie solidny, namiotowy śpiwór, bo taki domowy to już mam, ale on ciepły jest tylko symbolicznie, na lato jeszcze starczy, ale już na wiosnę?

      Propaguję doskonałe ''dolce far niente'', hm, może bym się wybrał na jakąś bardziej męczącą eskapadę, przydałoby się jakieś przygotowanie kondycyjne przed nauką jazdy na deskorolce; zdaje się że też ochraniaczne na kolana, bo się obijają; i jeszcze kask, ale to się mamuśkę może naciągnie.

      <strong>Chengdu, 2014-11-21 02:07:11 +0800<br />
      Day 89 in China</strong><br />
      I noticed a certain tendency in my social life in China. Whenever I meet a Korean girl (for some reason I don't really talk to any Korean boys,) if the whole social interaction is only about language exchange or simple friendship, everything is OK. The girls are usually delighted at my Korean (even I have to admit it's now better than some time ago, when even proclaiming my fondness for beer was a considerable effort; I can now talk about [[Blog:Elefanto/179._China_day_82._Daily_routines|daily routines]] or say ''my friend wants to know if your roommate has a boyfriend, or not''; still an awfully long way to go, though.) But when I meet a Korean girl and want to get somewhere further than just peaceful language practice, the girl just disappears without a trace. It already happened to the one next door; I haven't seen her in like 10 days (presumably more, but I already stopped counting,) and when I sent her a message on WeiXin to ask about the reason, the only message I got in reply was <span style="font-variant: small-caps">I don't want to talk to you</span>, in almost proper Chinese. The one I met last Saturday is not very talkative, but I prefer to believe it has something to do with the fact that she's immersed in a conflict with her future ex-boyfriend (ex-boyfriend to be?)

      <strong>2014-11-25 09:07:58 +0800<br />
      Day 93 in China</strong><br />
      Today I finally managed to get up anywhere earlier than 12:00. Contrary to common sense, I managed to do this in spite of several beers and clubbing last night. In fact, I think I only managed to do it <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">because</span> of all the beers and clubbing last night. Obviously, everything about clubbing and parties is different than in Poland. Beer, my fuel on many long trips, is very cheap in China, like 3 RMB a bottle. The problem is, it's actually soda water with some orange food coloring. They're all the same, 青島 Tsingtao, 哈爾濱 Harbin, 雪花 Snow and 燕京 Yanjing. You can drink this crap for one night after you come to China and pretend that you like it (or think that you like it because you drank so many of these the last time you came to China,) but then you realize it's not even good enough for pig fodder and you have to find something else. In the beginning, I opted for the Japanese beer 朝日 Asahi, but it's a bit watery, so after a few evenings with Japanese friends I slowly switched to 麒麟 Kirin. You can also get wheat beer of many sorts, but all of this is only available in 7-Eleven or fancy supermarkets in shiny new shopping malls like the IFS, Raffles City or the Global Centre, where an apple costs more than a kilogram of apples in Poland.

      Secondly, clubbing is also significantly different. In Poland, clubbing usually means drinking a lot before going out (this is called a ''before party'' in Ponglish) and having to pay an awful lot of money just for entering the club. Any alcohol bought in club will be similar quality to Tsingtao, but also similar price to any other bar or pub. If I happen to meet any attractive representant of whatever sex, I might soon be asked to proceed to the dancefloor, which I never do, because dancing sucks. In China, going to a club means first drinking some Kirins in 7-Eleven, then going to the club called Only, talking loudly in English about the people around (many Asians wouldn't understand English even if they walked into it accidentally in the street.) One small beer in a Chinese club costs about the same as a lunch in Poland, and contains a similar amount of alcohol. There are many comfy sofas all around, usually full of beautiful Chinese ladies playing their phones&mdash;they either came there with their friends and are bored, or came alone to find &ldquo;customers&rdquo;.

      <strong>2014-11-27 01:08:58 +0800<br />
      Day 95 in China</strong><br />
      On the train to Xi'An. I definitely cannot fall asleep. Every time I think of how much I cannot fall asleep, I remember the song by Travis called ''Why Does It Always Rain on Me''. My Linux at the moment is so freshly installed I don't even have the codecs for MP3, and thus cannot listen to music, which is a nuisance. But I remember a part of the lyrics quite well: &ldquo;Why does it always rain on me / is it because I lied when I was seventeen?&rdquo;

      I'm pretty sure that my current state of mind is caused by my immoral conduct in the recent years. More precisely, by going to sleep awfully late so many times that my body just got used to it. I've been doing many things so terribly wrong. I went to sleep late. I didn't study when I had to (although I don't really regret this one; I'm actually quite proud of my bad grades in school.) I skipped classes, but rather seldom and not in school. Back in the days of my youth, I even enjoyed going to classes. The school was the only place in my little world so boring that it encouraged me to read books. I've read many books by Pratchett; many about Buddhism; many Scandinavian criminal novels, mostly in English; the whole Harry Potter series; some random fantasy stuff, some compulsory reading, and many more I cannot name now, but I remember I enjoyed reading. I've read many books before I sold my mind to the consumerist world. I've read many books made of dead trees before I switched to e-books in the last year of high school. And there was social life. I met many attractive people back then. Before the world went crazy.

      I was selfish and treated my girlfriends badly. Not that I had many of them or spent a long time in relationships&mdash;on the contrary. But somehow, probably the first person I met in the dorms in Chengdu, a Korean girl studying Teaching Chinese to Foreigners, called me a playboy (she used the word 花花公子 hua1hua1 gong1zi, literally &ldquo;flower-flower prince&rdquo;) in my first week in China. What would she call the American guy who took a Chinese girl's virginity during ''his'' first week in China? The same girl has been on my mind a lot over the last few days. Thanks to her boundless compassion and wisdom, I realized there is no future for me in the world of polyglots. Every time I meet her at the university (fortunately, she's in my group, so it doesn't happen very often,) she tells me my Chinese altogether is quite OK, but my pronunciation sucks, especially in terms of intonation. On Tuesday I happened to eat some noodles (I think it might have been 白菜牛肉拌面, with Chinese cabbage and beef) with the aforementioned girl and another groupmate, from Thailand. The Korean told the Thai: 他的中文還不錯，就是他的發音不太好 (his Chinese is OK, but his pronunciation is not so good.) After the meal, I headed to 電腦城 (Computer Castle? Computer City? Computer Plaza?) to get some more empty DVDs, and on my way back, I bumped into the Korean and the Thai. They were endorsed in a profound and interesting conversation about some restaurants in an unknown part of the world, probably somewhere in China. I didn't know what they were talking about, so I said something totally irrelevant, which the Chinese took as a sign of not having a very good command of the Chinese language. I wasn't planning to defend my Chinese, but the Korean friend did it for me. She kindly informed the Chinese that I could speak their language quite well&hellip; but my pronunciation was not very good, especially in terms of intonation.

      I've been a bad person. I've been speaking bad Chinese. Somehow, my Chinese is getting worse and worse with every day in China. I've been mispronouncing so many words, not only in Chinese, but in other languages as well. For several years I pronounced the word ''coffee'' as KUH-fee, even though it's actually KOH-fee. I have a thick Polish accent in all languages I speak, which must be particularly funny with Asian languages. But in the end, it doesn't even matter. I still speak better Mandarin than many Chinese. I heard that even university professors in fields not related to languages tend to speak their dialects in the lectures. I don't want to graduate and be a Sinologist with shitty pronunciation, but as long as Thai people understand my Chinese, Kazakhs my Russian and Mexicans my Mexican, I probably don't have to look for a new major.

      I could maybe try to study Chinese a bit harder than not at all. Then what I'm doing in China wouldn't be a lost year. I can find excuses for many things, but I don't want to find excuses for wasting my time.

      Dzień 106 w Chinach</strong><br />
      Moja Macocha wyznała ostatnio w prywatnej korespondencji, że stęskniła się za moją publicystyką w Języku Ojczystym. Przez ostatnie trzy lata z hakiem wszystkie nocie pisałem bowiem w języku Jankesów, nie licząc kilku razy, kiedy zdecydowałem się wypacać swe zbereźności w języku chińskim &mdash; tych jednak było zdecydowanie najmniej. Od momentu, kiedy przestawiłem się z książek analogowych na e-booki, niemal wszystko, co czytałem, było po angielsku; dlatego też zwykle nazywałem go „językiem normalnym”. Nic więc dziwnego, że ostatnimi czasy niemałą trudność sprawia mi wypowiedzenie się w Języku Ojczystym o czymkolwiek bardziej wyrafinowanym, niż Pieniądze bądź Dupa Maryni. Co się tyczy tego ostatniego, to jest to raczej w sensie przenośnym, gdyż w Państwie Środka kobiety o tym imieniu występują stosunkowo rzadko. Kojarzę tylko jedną długonogą blondynę z Ukrainy o imieniu Darina, aczkolwiek jej poślady jakoś nigdy przesadnie mnie nie zajmowały.

      Dawno również nie pisałem nic odręcznie, a jeżeli już, to w celach naukowych, po chińsku albo koreańsku. Nawet jednak po koreańsku ostatnio pisałem głównie na komputerze &mdash; po pierwsze primo, bo jest szybciej, a po wtóre, bo nie trzeba się przy tym martwić ostrością ołówka, gramaturą papieru, kątem nachylenia łokcia i całą resztą czynników, które onegdaj spędzały sen z powiek domorosłym gryzipiórkom. Kiedy ja sam byłem młodocianym publicystą, dane mi było żyć w zgoła innym otoczeniu, niż to, w którym bytuję obecnie. Bo życie w Chinach to nie przelewki. Siedzenie w Chinach i pisanie blogaska, w nie mniejszym stopniu niż poważne studia w Poznaniu, może wywierać silny wpływ na psychikę, a nierzadko również powodować trwały uszczerbek na zdrowiu. Oba miejsca obfitują bowiem w obcokrajowców, kluby oraz suto zakrapiane alkoholem, papierosami oraz twardymi prochami studenckie imprezy, choć muszę przyznać, że pod tym względem chińskie wyobrażenie o dobrej zabawie znacząco odbiega od polskiego. W całych Chinach największym jednak zagrożeniem są ci Przedziwni Jegomoście z różnych stron świata, którzy raczej prędzej niż później wciągają cię w nielekką kabałę.

      Na przykład w sobotę wieczorem, kiedy już planowałem poćwiczyć jogę, pomedytować i, w dalszej perspektywie, udać się spać o jakiejś w miarę chrześcijańskiej porze (zwykle chodzę spać w porze raczej buddyjskiej), otrzymałem na ŁejSinie, zwanym przez niemówiących po chińsku WeChatem, wiadomość od pewnej niewiasty, którą poznałem przeszło trzy lata temu w Nankinie.<br />
      ''Jestem w Chengdu'', brzmiała wiadomość.<br />
      Wspomniana koleżanka przesiedziała ostatnio ładnych parę miesięcy w Ghanie, gdzie dorabiała jako tłumacz chińsko-angielski, utrzymując przy tym niewiernego chińskiego konkubenta, który nic nie robił, tylko chodził od klubu do klubu i wydawał jej ciężko zarobione pieniądze, a w dodatku ostatnio okazało się, że jest żonaty i ma dwójkę dzieci. Obecnie wróciła do Ojczyzny i zamierza spędzić tu bliżej nieokreślony czas.

      Po pobieżnej medytacji oraz prostym posiłku udałem się do niewielkiego pubu w okolicach Zachodniej Bramy Uniwersytetu Syczuańskiego (z przyczyn osobistych wolę nie nazywać go Swoją Uczelnią) o nazwie Beer Nest, gdzie uraczyłem się całkiem smacznym piwem pszenicznym, ginem z tonikiem koleżanki oraz zakupioną uprzednio w sklepie flaszeczką jinjiu (勁酒). Gnieździło się tam, oprócz ww. niewiasty, wielu obcokrajowców. Ku memu ubolewaniu, było też pełne podstarzałych Chinek po trzydziestce, które czyhały tylko na młodych, przystojnych obcokrajowców, których mogłyby wykorzystać (tzn. mówić do nich po angielsku) i porzucić. Wspomniałem jednej z takich harpii mimochodem o znajomości z pewną niezwykle sympatyczną Tajwanką, którą nawiązałem jakieś półtora tygodnia temu w pociągu do Xi'Anu, i że nie mogę z nią pojechać do Szanghaju i Hangzhou, bo nie mam na to obecnie hajsu. Podstarzała Chinka w przypływie szczodrości poinformowała mnie więc, że mogę w Chinach nauczać angielskiego.<br />
      &mdash; Możesz uczyć angielskiego. 200 juanów za godzinę, popracujesz sobie po dwie godzinki pięć razy w tygodniu i już masz 8000 na miesiąc.<br />
      &mdash; Cudownie &mdash; odparłem. &mdash; Dzięki ci, Pani, za światło tej nauki.<br />
      Byłaby to naprawdę wspaniała wiadomość, gdyby nie fakt, że raczej mało kto w tej branży poszukuje nieogarniętego Polaka bez doświadczenia i wykształcenia, którego angielski jest ponadto raczej do dupy. Poza tym i tak właśnie czekam na wypłatę za listopad, która nadejdzie tak późno, że to już naprawdę musztarda po obiedzie.

      Z Beer Nest wraz z koleżanką i koleżanką koleżanki poszliśmy do Helen's, jednego z tych barów targetujących w obcokrajowców, które wszędzie w Chinach wyglądają tak samo, niezależnie od szerokości geograficznej i wysokości nad poziomem morza, gdzie sprzedaje się rozwodnione Tsingtao za kilkanaście juanów, albo drinki na bazie wody sodowej za czterdzieści, gdzie wszyscy prędzej czy później zamawiają wielką fajkę wodną i przepalają nią odzież, skórę oraz lakier na stołach, i które są przez to tak szalenie nudne, że nawet Andrzeja Warchoła mogłyby zniechęcić do picia. Jedyną zaletą Helen's w Chengdu przy ulicy Brokatowej jest to, że można pojechać windą na 21. piętro i oglądać nocną panoramę tej wielkiej metropolii, aby następnie pójść do jednego z licznych klubów tanecznych, mieszczących się na tych wysokościach, np. Here We Go (Tutaj Idziemy).

      W Helen's zostałem poczęstowany wiadrem ginu z tonikiem, a kiedy już jedna z koleżanek zgubiła gdzieś pod stołem pierścionek, a druga przepaliła węgielkiem od fajki wodnej blat, przesiedliśmy się, by siać spustoszenie gdzie indziej. Ponieważ było już dosyć późno, i lokal pustoszał, wnet dołączyło do nas więcej ludzi. Kogóż tam nie było! Były Amerykanki, które przedstawiały się ''Hi, we're stupid Americans'', choć tak w ogóle sprawiały wrażenie całkiem rozgarniętych. Byli jacyś Chińczycy. Wreszcie pojawił się także Australijczyk, który z przejęciem opowiadał, jak chwilę wcześniej omal nie zginął w następstwie rozboju w biały dzień. Kiedy już w barze nie było nikogo, a w Chinach następuje to dużo wcześniej, niż w Europie Wschodniej, już koło trzeciej, poszliśmy na schody ewakuacyjne, by wspólnie uraczyć się działką wybornego afgańskiego haszyszu. Potem dziewczyny rozjechały się taksówkami do domu, zaś ja zostałem tylko z Australijczykiem. Uraczywszy się pospiesznie butelką koniaku, pojechaliśmy motorem do jego ulubionego baru, gdzieś koło Drugiej Obwodnicy (二環路), Południowej Ulicy Ludowej (人民南路) i Nefrytowego Lasu (玉林). Gdzie dokładnie &mdash; nie pomnę.

      Następny lokal na naszej trasie był chyba najlepszym barem, w jakim byłem jak dotąd w Chinach. Atmosferą i wystrojem dorównywał takim klasykom koszalińskiego życia nocnego, jak BWA, Centrala a nawet Zacisze za życia Szeryfa. Tam również nie było już zbyt wielu ludzi. Oprócz szefa, jakiejś młodej Chinki władającej całkiem nienajgorszym angielskim i właściciela baru, śpiącego w narkotycznym transie na kanapie, były tam chyba tylko dwie osoby. Jedna z nich okazała się grubą rybą w biurze tłumaczeń, dzięki czemu załatwiłem sobie tam praktyki studenckie. Pewien muskularny Amerykanin o łysym czerepie i mętnym wzroku spytał mnie, czy chcę się zabawić, czyniąc przy tym dobrze mi znany gest dotykania nosa.<br />
      &mdash; Jasne &mdash; odparłem bez chwili wahania.<br />
      Na szklanym blacie stołu uczyniliśmy kilka sympatycznych ścieżek, by następnie wciągnąć je przez banknot stujuanowy. Cóż to był za koks! Nie brałem tak dobrego towaru chyba od drugiej liceum, a trzeba przyznać, że koszalińscy dilerzy, jak i poznańscy, do swego fachu podchodzili niezwykle poważnie.

      <strong>2014-12-15 08:05:39 +0100<br />
      Dzień 113 w Chinach</strong><br />
      W drodze na narty. Moja uczennica postanowiła zabrać mnie ze sobą na wyjazd w góry. Jako argument przemawiający za wyborem mnie podała fakt, iż wyjazd jest w poniedziałek, a kto jak kto, ale ''ja'' na pewno mam wtedy czas. Muszę przyznać, że miała rację.

      Wczoraj wieczorem uraczyłem się z Adrianem koreańskim żarciem za ciężkie pieniądze (równowartość 45 zł za dwie osoby i górę żarcia) i pewną ilością napojów wyskokowych. Następnie spotkałem Nepalczyków palących trawę z okazji urodzin i pojechałem z nimi do Jellyfish. Stamtąd z grupą Anglików pojechałem do Only, gdzie ochroniarze w bardzo agresywny sposób skonfiskowali mój alkohol. Chińska żona jednego z Anglików stwierdziła, że konfiskowanie alkoholu w ten sposób uwłacza ludzkiej godności i w związku z tym ona tam nie chce wchodzić.

      Ja natomiast wszedłem i spotkałem tam, oprócz kolejnych Anglików, mojego austro-niderlandzko-australijskiego przyjaciela Ryszarda, który onegdaj przejechał na motorze 15 000 km z Guilin na południowym wschodzie Chin do Xinjiangu na północnym wschodzie. Zajęło mu to 100 dni, w którym to czasie przebywał w ChRL na lipnej wizie biznesowej. Kiedy milicjanci pytali, co robi w Chinach, odpowiadał tylko „學習中國文化” („studiuję kulturę Chin”). „Tylko Straż Graniczna na lotnisku rozumie, co tak naprawdę znaczą te literki na wizie. A wtedy to i tak nie ma żadnego znaczenia.” Na długi weekend z okazji rocznicy proklamowania Chińskiej Republiki Ludowej (1-7 października), zamiast, tak jak niektórzy, pojechać najtańszą kuszetką w jakieś zwyczajne miejsce, Ryszard kupił za 2100 juanów używaną rikszę motorową, zwaną popularnie 三輪車 albo tuk-tukiem. Przy takim pojeździe, stary dobry Fiat 126p jest, nie przymierzając, demonem prędkości, dysponuje również zbliżoną ładownością. Ryszard zapakował na ten pojazd dwóch kumpli z bagażami i zapasem piwa Duvel i pojechał autostradą w góry. Jakby tego było mało, nie miał śpiwora, więc w drogę zabrał kołdrę z akademika w olśniewająco białej poszwie, którą później owijał sobie nogi, gdy prowadząc motór wśród górskich przełęczy zdał sobie sprawę, iż zapomniał długich spodni. Oprócz tego, Ryszard ukończył prestiżowy londyński SOAS, przy którym poznańska sinologia jest jeno Politechniką Koszalińską. Studia te oraz nieprzeciętna inteligencja sprawiły, że mówi po chińsku dużo lepiej ode mnie. Jakby tego było mało, jest też zabójczo przystojny i wysportowany. Jednak, bym nie czuł się od niego dużo gorszy, Bozia pokarała go leworęcznością. Dzięki temu nie jest w stanie prześcignąć mnie w zakresie odręcznego pisania po chińsku.

      Kiedy go spotkałem, było już grubo po dobranocce, mniej więcej koło trzeciej. Ryszard wyznał, że przez ostatnie trzy dni cały czas był na lekkim rauszu. Mimo iż była to niedziela, lokal pełen był syczuańskiej bananowej młodzieży oraz młodych, pięknych kobiet w farbowanych włosach i mocnym makijażu, leniwie sączących przy stoliku jedno piwo. (BTW. Nie wiem, czy wiecie, ale słowo „frajer” w języku niemieckim, ''Freier'', oznacza właśnie klienta takiej niewiasty.) O ile w europejskich klubach parkiet jako przestrzeń do tańca jest zwykle największą i najważniejszą częścią lokalu, o tyle w Azji raczej nikt tak naprawdę nie tańczy, w związku z czym większą część powierzchni lokali zajmują stoliki z bardzo wygodnymi kanapami (obitymi wodoodpornym, zmywalnym materiałem). Kiedy go spotkałem, Ryszard „tańczył” na podwyższeniu. Opodal „tańczyła” jakaś młoda i niebrzydka Chinka. Uśmiechnęła się do mnie. Nie pamiętam już, czy się do niej odśmiechnąłem, czy nie &mdash; dziewczęta nieszczególnie mnie bowiem interesują. Ale ponieważ zawarliśmy już wówczas pewien rodzaj więzi, kiedy później stałem przed lokalem i piłem z jednym Anglikiem rozpuszczalnik nitro z Pepsi, a ona udawała się do domku, na wszelki wypadek wziąłem na nią namiary.

      Do akademika wróciłem jakoś po czwartej. Spotkałem tam Ryszarda oraz owego Amerykanina, który podczas swojego pierwszego tygodnia w Chinach pozbawił pewną Chinkę cnoty, w następstwie czego inni Amerykanie nazywali go ''Red John'' („Czerwony Jan”). Spytałem Czerwonego Jana, czy nie chciałby może pojechać ze mną i moją uczennicą na narty, jednakowoż zdecydował się nie jechać, gdyż stwierdził, że nie może sobie pozwolić na trzydniową nieobecność tuż przed sesją. Umyłem zęby i poszedłem spać. Byłem już bardzo zmęczony. Obudziłem się w bardzo złym stanie. Obmyłem ciało swe od nieczystości, zgoliłem pod prysznicem rachityczny zarost na mordzie. Ponieważ w Chengdu w akademiku jest ogółem bardzo zimno, prysznice nierzadko się wydłużają. Aby nie nudzić się samemu pod prysznicem, zwykle puszczam muzykę z komórki. Inspirując się Azjatami, którzy kucając nad kiblem bawią się telefonami i palą ćmiki, wpadłem kiedyś na pomysł picia pod prysznicem browarów, ale obecnie nie robię tego zbyt często, najwyżej osiem razy dziennie. Po wyjściu spod prysznica spotkałem Nepalkę z 322, która mimo późnego powrotu i wysokiej zawartości wszystkiego we krwi poszła na zajęcia. Podziwiam.

      <div style="font-variant: bold; text-align: center;">= * * * * * * * =</div>

      Moje życie codzienne w Chengdu nie jest szczególnie urozmaicone. Zwykle wychodzę z akademika tylko na żarcie, czasem do sklepu albo na randomowe wyprawy po mieście z młodymi, ładnymi Chinkami, nierzadko z ''happy endem'' (tzn. jedzeniem). Kiedy jeszcze byłem szczęśliwym posiadaczem roweru, również nie miałem okazji ujrzeć ogromu tej tętniącej życiem metropolii, jaką jest Chengdu. Widziałem tylko uliczki, ulice, drogi, lecz zawsze z poziomu chodnika. Jednak jadąc samochodem bądź taksówką można wjechać na drogi szybkiego ruchu, obwodnice, ślimaki i inne estakady (jak to napisał Mój Stary o estakadach w centrum Chongqingu: „niezłe spaghetti”) i ujrzeć niekończące się morze trzydziestopiętrowych bloków, wieżowców i takich tam. Dziś właśnie takimi drogami jechałem na umówione miejsce spotkania z uczennicą (przy Wielkiej Drodze Markiza Wu).

      I to górskie powietrze po prawie czterech miesiącach w wielomilionowych metropoliach! I tylko zaawansowane ''delirium tremens'' nie pozwalało mi w pełni cieszyć się tymi, jakże wspaniałymi, okolicznościami przyrodniczymi. Miałem zamiar pójść do apteki i dotruć się lekami bez recepty, aż w końcu wpadłem na pomysł wzięcia ''Natrium sulphuricum'' i wszystko przeszło. Moje dotychczasowe poglądy na leczenie kaca legły w gruzach.

      Minęliśmy Wenchuan. To tu 12 maja 2008 roku zatrzęsła się ziemia. W Syczuanie trzęsień ziemi jest całe mnóstwo, ale najwyraźniej wszystkie przespałem. I dobrze.

      <!-- Podróże Małe i Duże. 182. China day 128. SPA, 溝 and why you cannot enter the same Xi'an twice -->
      <strong>Gu'ergou SPA Hotel (古爾溝溫泉山莊), Autonomiczna Prefektura Ngawa Mniejszości Qiang i Zang (阿壩藏族羌族自治州), 2014-12-16 17:56:19 +0100<br />
      Dzień 114 w Chinach</strong><br />
      Jestem w SPA, gdzieś w górach, w zachodnim Syczuanie. Nie jest to oczywiście SPA w takim sensie, do jakiego przywykłem w Polsce, z sauną fińską i rzymską, małym basenem, leżakami, kapciuszkami kąpielowymi, szlafrokami, olejkami eterycznymi i maszyną do kostek lodu, który można potem wrzucać za kołnierz znajomym i krewnym; z ciągle tą samą muzyką relaksacyjną i zabiegami kosmetyczno-ogólnorozwojowymi. Obiekt wygląda jak zamrożone w czasie lata 80., z tym że w latach 80. nie mógłbym, oczywiście, wozić ze sobą komputera i pisać blogaska. Uczennica, z którą tu przyjechałem (i która wpadła na pomysł całej tej eskapady w środku tygodnia, przewiozła mnie tu i ufundowała właściwie jak dotąd prawie wszystko), narzekała, że w pokojach śmierdzi. Ja właściwie nie zauważyłem żadnego szczególnie uciążliwego smrodu, może też dlatego, że sam nie pachnę najpiękniej. Mam tylko dla siebie pokój dwuosobowy z łazienką, telewizorem i czajnikiem, nie ma za to Wifi ani centralnego ogrzewania.

      Jeśli chodzi o SPA, to jak dotąd widziałem właściwie tylko niewielki (ale też niemały) odkryty basen z wodą termalną. Jest on na tyle odkryty, że czasem śnieg pada na głowę, ale kąpać się można, od biedy można nawet popływać. Woda jest czysta i ciepła, nie jakoś powalająco gorąca, ale też nie chce się z niej wychodzić, ani nawet wystawiać głowy ponad powierzchnię. Nad wszystkim czuwa marmurowy posąg obnażającej się niewiasty.

      Kiedy już przyjechaliśmy do tej wioski i zakwaterowaliśmy się, poszliśmy na kolację. Nie wiem do końca, dlaczego, ale to miejsce skojarzyło mi się z małymi wioskami gdzieś na dalekiej Syberii &mdash; prawdopodobnie dlatego, że nigdy nie byłem w Rosji, a tym bardziej na Syberii. Nie miałem wielkich wymagań: byłem gotów zjeść cokolwiek, byleby to nie był rosół z kozy, cuchnący stajnią. Trafiliśmy do niewielkiej restauracji tuż koło hotelu. Na ścianie w sali wisiała haftowana martwa natura. Telewizor pokazywał oficjalne wiadomości na CCTV13; akurat puszczali reportaż o zmianach, jakie dokonały się w ciągu piętnastu lat po powrocie Makau do ChRL. Uśmiechnięci reporterzy rozmawiali z uśmiechniętymi, a czasem i nieuśmiechniętymi, mieszkańcami, którzy z kantońskim akcentem opowiadali o życiu w dawnej portugalskiej kolonii. Zgodnie z syczuańskim zwyczajem, w restauracji nie było ogrzewania. Wprawdzie temperatura na sali była znacznie wyższa niż na zewnątrz, ale przy każdym oddechu z ust wydobywał się słup pary. Przy sąsiednim stoliku siedziało czworo ludzi. Pewien łysy jegomość wraz z małżonką przyglądali mi się uważnie. Później tego wieczoru, ów jegomość powiedział mi, że zastanawiał się wtedy, czy aby rozumiem ich język. Ale jego małżonka powiedziała: „Od razu, jak go zobaczyłam, wiedziałam, że na pewno mówi po chińsku. Biały niemówiący po chińsku nigdy by się tu nie zapuszczał.” Kiedy już wyszedłem z szafy i przemówiłem swoją łamaną chińszczyzną, okazało się, że ludzie ci mieszkają w tym samym hotelu i akurat wybierają się wieczorem na radosne pluskanie w gorących źródłach (po chińsku mówi się na to 泡溫泉).

      Ponieważ w pierwotnym zamyśle wyjechałem na narty, a na nartach zawsze prędzej czy później idzie się do sauny albo na basen, zabrałem ze sobą kąpielówki i okulary pływackie. Wprawdzie pływam jeszcze gorzej, niż gram na trąbce, ale lubię od czasu do czasu zanurkować na dno brodzika i policzyć ryby. W tym akurat doliczyłem się tylko jednej. Pluskałem się i udawałem, że pływam, a uczennica nawet nie udawała, bo ma słaby wzrok i nie chciała pływać po omacku. W końcu przyszło Pogodne Chińskie Małżeństwo. Kąpali się, rozmawiali radośnie po syczuańsku, a w pewnym momencie, zdaje się, kopulowali przez pewien czas pod powierzchnią wody. Potem trochę rozmawialiśmy. Pamiętam, że mówił wtedy o atrakcjach w Bipenggou (畢棚溝), i że słowo 湖泊 (hu2po1, jezioro) wymawiał jako „fupo”. Pogodny Pan nauczył mnie wówczas słowa, o którym moja uczennica mówiła, że jest bardzo nieładne, i że na jego dźwięk każda szanująca się syczuańska dziewczyna powinna się zaczerwienić, albo nawet obrazić.

      Dzień 115 w Chinach</strong><br />
      Najwolniejszy internet, z jakim się zetknąłem w czasie podróży po Chinach. Drugie miejsce po tanim hotelu w Sofii. Od pół godziny próbuję załadować na Fejsa kilka zdjęć z Bipenggou (畢棚溝). Do tej pory nie jestem pewien, co oznacza znak „溝”.

      <strong>2014-12-30 00:34:40 +0800<br />
      Day 128 in China</strong><br />
      Once again I'm on the train to Xi'an. I wouldn't normally travel to the same place twice, given how many places I still haven't visited in China, but this time it's really not just for traveling or sightseeing. The real reason I'm going there is the amazingly likable Taiwanese girl I met on the train to Xi'an the last time. The other real reason it that I'm going to celebrate New Year's Eve there.

      I got the middle bunk this time, but I exchanged it with some Chinese man, so I sleep on the top bunk once again. It's a bit of a nuisance. In this train, for Hard Sleepers there is a sort of half-closed compartments, which implies several things:

      * people won't be staring at your feet while you sleep,
      * it is much easier to get on your bunk, because you don't have to climb from the side of the window, but you just climb from one bunk to the other, plus there are things to help you climb, like small steps where you can put your feet,
      * it means that all space for luggage is actually in your compartment, and it's harder to get it down than if it's in the corridor.

      Last time I went to Xi'an, I took with me a big red suitcase and a smaller backpack to act as carry-on luggage while traveling, but shortly afterwards I realized I didn't actually need half of all the stuff I brought; like that huge melon and yoga mat
      &mdash;I never did yoga during the 6 days or so in Xi'an, and I could buy a melon just as well in Xi'an. My friend also found it quite funny that in such big a suitcase there were not enough clothes for the whole stay (哈哈 你帶一大堆東西不帶衣服).

      For the last years I've been really ignorant about what was happening in the big world and even my own country. But in China I cannot use Facebook from my dumbphone, so pretty often when I'm eating or doing the opposite thing, I get to read some Chinese news from Bing. They are usually politically biased and probably don't say too much about the situation in Poland, but there is something about the news in Poland that really bugs me.

      Remember what news looked like, say, ten years ago? When you opened a news portal, like Gazeta.pl or Onet.pl, what you saw were headlines dealing with the most important matters, first in Poland, then in the other galaxies. When there were big news, like of a terrorist attack or natural disaster, they would be written in big red letters on the top of the page. All headlines were meaningful and told you more or less what the article was about. It's still like this in Germany. It's still like this in big Western countries. It's still like this in China. The news may be all made up, they may be manipulated and stuff, but they still follow some rules of journalism.

      And Poland? When I want to read some Polish news and open, say, Onet, the first thing I see is a bunch of ads (well, or I would probably see them without AdBlock Plus,) then a few meaningless headlines about the political situation in Poland, which recently made a long way from bad to funny, from funny to pathetic, then from pathetic to really embarassing. These are never written in a direct, factual way; if they were, no one would ever read them. Instead of writing something like &ldquo;The Soviet Union To Sign a Treaty with Burkina Faso,&rdquo; they would probably say something like &ldquo;These Damn Niggers Can Kiss My Buttocks, Says Putin&rdquo;. Then you would open the page to find out no one actually said anything like that and that all the article is about is some lousy treaty. After political news comes sport and celebrities, with things like conflicts in the Middle East, famine or earthquakes omitted, because everyone knows the world is not an easy place, anyway. When they write about celebrities, they always write something like &ldquo;See What Marta Wierzbicka Showed on TVN,&rdquo; but there is usually no point in opening, unless you're interested in a bombshell showing her new collection of winter jackets, sponsored by TVN. Or whatever. Geez, when some kids were slaughtered somewhere in Pakistan, I found out about it via Avaaz, and on the following day there was nothing about it on Onet. When the prices of petrol dropped by a quarter in Poland, I first heard about it from my family when they came over for Christmas. Well, whatever, I don't think I should care, anyway.

      The cool thing about many things in China is that they look like the 80s. This train looks exactly like this.

      <!-- Travels Small and Big. 183. China day 135. My Newer New Year's Resolution -->
      <strong>Chongqing, 2015-01-06 02:50:55 +0800<br />
      Day 135 in China</strong><br />
      The title says &ldquo;newer&rdquo; because I've already written a post about [[Blog:Elefanto/110._My_New_Year's_resolution|my New Year's Resolution]] once, though on that occasion I didn't really choose the title. Back then, my English teacher in high school wanted me to write an essay about why I shouldn't be late for classes. Now, I want to go back to at least reasonable sleeping habits I had before I came to China. I remember a period in my life when I could easily get up before seven in the morning. In China, ten is rather early, nine way too early and eight the impossible low line. So this time my New Year's Resolution really is to get up earlier.

      I came to Chongqing for the second time. Just like everywhere in China, you can't really come to the same city twice, because ''panta rhei''. The last time (see: [[Blog:Elefanto/177. 在中國第48天。重慶|177. 在中國第48天。重慶]], only Chinese) I came alone, and on the first evening I went out for moderate clubbing at Jiaochangkou 較場口 with a random Chinese guy. Back then, there was a really fancy restaurant selling Taiwanese Yangchun Noodles 陽春面. They had comfy red seats and a big TV set showing Chinese fantasy movies (as opposed to usual TV sets in Chinese restaurants that only show current TV programmes, which are usually pretty bad.) There was also a lively club with people going in and out and definitely too many Stars of David on the façade. When I came there today, this time with the Amazingly Likable Taiwanese Friend (ALTF,) three quarters of the pavement were torn out to be replaced. It probably wasn't really very old, but then again, it China it doesn't really matter. Here, buildings are built at the expense of countless resources and people's labor only to be torn down when they are not needed anymore, often after just a few years. The restaurant still existed, but not in the same premises; in the original restaurant was now a fancy, big, Italian-style restaurant, while the place with Yangchun noodles was moved to the side. The waiter said that was because the new restaurant belonged to the owner's friend (she said 我們老闆的兄弟) and that they still sold the same noodles. I ordered the Yangchun noodles (臺灣陽春面) and my companion Little Noodles with Wontons (小面加抄手). The ALTF said the noodles were very good and very authentic.

      The interesting thing about Chongqing is that the city was built on countless hills and mountains. Even in the city centre, the district called 渝中區 Yuzhong, skyscrapers are built on steep slopes and tiny pieces of land. But the most impressive of all is their metro, built in steep slopes, right below existing skyscrapers, and in such scenery they even managed to build a transit station. Also, sometimes a pedestrian track happens to go next to an existing building. In such case bridges and elevated paths are build to connect them with the building. You just walk around and find a small bridge. You cross it and find out that you're on the 12th floor of some block of flats from the 1960s. Sometimes on the 10th floor you find a small grocery store with water, alcohol, cigarettes and instant noodles (方便面). In one such building there was an unused rubbish chute and a lot of rubbish right next to it. In another, there was no light somewhere around 4th floor. The ALTF is afraid of darkness. Luckily, for Christmas I got a small flashlight with a dynamo. It's just perfect for dispersing darkness.

      <strong>2015-01-16 12:56:25 +0800<br />
      Day 145 in China</strong><br />
      The Amazingly Likable Taiwanese Friend is gone. She left for Xi'an on Wednesday evening from Chengdu North railway station. In five days she'll be going back to Taiwan.

      Many other people are also gone, mostly Korean and Thai. Some of them will come back after the winter holidays, some won't. For most people, their stay in the Overseas Students' Dormitory was like a longer vacation, where they could meet new friends, earn some illegal money, buy a lot of Chinese cigarettes, drugs and other stuff, and then take it home, be it the US, Vietnam, Thailand or Tajikistan. Those who leave usually leave behind a huge pile of stuff they don't need anymore (and probably never needed,) mostly clothes, rice cookers, and beddings. Those who stay here longer then take whatever they might find useful from these piles and, over the years, turn into overloaded draught animals, possessing too much stuff to be able to move freely.

      But the most painful parting was not with anyone from the dorms, but with the intermediary company for which I taught some English for quite a while. I was probably their worst English tutor ever, and my student had a similar working attitude to mine. I didn't like them too much right from the moment when they gave me their first student. The working atmosphere, or rather the atmosphere in the office was quite good, or rather too good. They were always smiling when they told me, often in very bad English, that I should do something exactly in their way. Their wage was also below the lowest market price, and it turned out the company took over 40% commission. I first resigned through WeChat and they said it was okay and that they would arrange to find a new tutor for my student. Then my student told them she wanted to terminate the contract. Then I went to the office to get paid one day too early. The three women I always saw smiling widely were now obviously pissed off. They told me I never sent them a formal resignation letter and therefore was not officialy dismissed. Then again, in more than a month I didn't hold a single class with the student, for which I deserved a penalty, according to the contract. They decided not to punish me in any way, however, and said they didn't care, because their company had lots of other tutors, most probably less irresponsible.

      The funny part: I quit right at the end of term. Everyone they had has either went home already, will go home soon or is not in Chengdu right now. The only people who tend to stick with their company are natives who care about the number of classes in a week than about the wage for a single class. I doubt any single one of them will care about such an unattractive job offer. This is pure evil. But then again, I had to quit or I would be punished for traveling.

      Tomorrow I'm going south. For now, I only have a ticket to Guiyang 貴陽, the capital of Guizhou 貴州, the poorest province of PRC. I want to spend around a week in Guizhou, then maybe visit Guilin 桂林, world-famous for its beautiful landscape, then maybe the Hunan 湖南 or Guangdong 廣東 province. I'm going alone, mostly by train. The Spring Festival is next month, and I have to do whatever is possible to avoid staying in China during that time.

      <strong>On the train to Guiyang, 2015-01-17 20:42:57 +0800<br />
      Day 146 in China</strong><br />
      One of the Bigger Travels began. I left for Guiyang, the capital of China's poorest province, from Chengdu East railway station on 7.05 p.m. I don't know when I'll come back. I actually only planned the first day of my travel, and have a list of interesting places around Guiyang I got from a girl I met in Chongqing. -->
      <strong>在去貴陽的火車上, 2015-01-17 20:42:57 +0800<br />
      在中國第146天<strong><br />

      我的大規模旅遊由此開始。今天晚上7.05點在成都東火車站上了開往貴州省省會貴陽的火車。貴州這個省很貧窮，是全國最貧窮的一個省。據說貴州的物價還算挺便宜的。我不太清楚什麼時候要回成都。我其實只安排了在貴陽的第一天，而我電腦上有一個在重慶認識的一個女生寫給我的目錄，在那裏寫著一些貴陽及其附近的景點。我這次坐的火車還算挺好的，甚至有坐便器。只不過最惱人的是，直到晚上9點，我的臥鋪旁邊的擴音器一直在播放什麼音樂，而且音樂聲很大。我只是覺得，選擇的自由對於一個社會是一件非常要緊的事。或許有的人不太喜歡聽音樂。或許有一些人的音樂品味跟鐵路公司職員的品味有很大不一樣。或許鐵路公司可以向它的貴賓提供關音樂的功能。
      <!-- 我估計，如果硬臥跟軟臥的差別真的很明顯，那麼它們之間的差別一定在於有沒有可能控制音量。如果我是中國鐵道公司的總經理，我就會這樣做：這樣客戶可以選擇很便宜的硬臥，但是音樂聲一直在耳朵旁邊喧囂個不停，也可以買很貴的軟臥，那麼每一間車廂都有很大的牌子，上面寫著“在這兒可以控制音量”這些字。我認爲，如果真的有這樣的選擇，我每次坐火車都會選擇軟臥。-->

      音樂聲停止後，我才發現牆上有個開關，上面寫著“揚音器”，原來我一直都可以把音樂關上。

      <strong>2015-01-24 15:05:24 +0800<br />
      在中國第153天</strong><br />
      前幾天我或者在貴陽，或者在貴陽附近的小城市。來這裏之前，我還以爲在這麼貧窮的地區物價應該還比較便宜。後來我才知道，雖然貴州工資很低，但是物價跟四川差不多，有的東西還比四川貴。尤其是景區的門票：黃果樹瀑布的全票是160塊，這個價格還不包括去景區的觀光車票。我一共只參觀了三個地方：貴陽的黔靈山公園、凱里附近的西江苗寨、還有天河潭。

      <strong>貴陽北站。</strong>我今天上午還打算去銅仁，但考慮很多元素以後，我便決定最好不要去。我想去銅仁的原因其實是因爲在那裏有一個貴州美女（雖然我最近把全所有美女叫做“醜女”，因爲美女只可以有一個）。那個女生長得很可愛，個子不高，大約1米5，而她的面孔比較像是十三歲的少女。但其實銅仁本身沒有什麼好看的，周圍惟一的景區是梵淨山。坐大巴去銅仁大概要坐6個小時，而且在那裏還沒有青年旅舍。我終於決定還是去桂林。到桂林只消坐2個半小時的動車，貴州這個省還算挺漂亮的，但是我哪裏都沒有去，因爲距離太遠了。要想去任何地方參觀，必須要先坐兩個小時火車，然後到了另一個城市再乘坐大巴。出發最好的時間大概是早上8點，要不然沒辦法按時到達目的地。我在貴陽住了一家非常小的青年旅舍。具體說，那也算不上是青年旅舍，而是客棧。關鍵是一夜才35塊人民幣。

      今天上午我先去了貴陽火車站買去桂林的票。我背上是很大的背包（它證明我是個背包客），手裏拿著我冬天的外套（因爲我沒想到在貴州沒有真正的冬天），還端著一個破爛的袋子，裏面是一大把香蕉。火車站前面有好多人要麼要給你賣什麼東西，要麼直接向你乞求錢，還有一個男生想免費給我什麼東西，但首先要給他我的什麼個人信息。我告訴他我沒有時間，要趕火車，他卻不讓步，而且還說“我不想要你的香蕉！我不想要你的香蕉！”

      怪得很，有一些去桂林的火車全部票早已賣完了，有一些卻依然有好多張。買票的時候，我才發現我的火車是從另一個火車站出發。由於剩下來的票全是些從貴陽北站出發的車，所以我只好到貴陽北站去坐我的車。來貴陽以前，我還認爲交通最不方便的城市是昆明。可是貴陽還比昆明不方便。我從火車站坐了224路公交車，坐車前還要排隊好長時間，那一刻有個老太太告訴我，我手裏的香蕉都已經爛了（她明明不知道最好吃的香蕉就是那些最不好看的，上面有很多斑的）。然後還有一個比我大概小三歲的男生問我要去哪兒。我沒有告訴他我想去哪兒，他卻說，224路不到那兒，應該坐另一路的車。但我沒有相信他，因爲其實不管是在哪兒，在火車前面最好不要相信任何人。下午2點貴陽非常堵，一般來說只需要10分鍾的距離變成20分，汽車上是人山人海，而且還有什麼女生（長得挺安全）跟我打招呼，然後還請我給她寫下來我的電話號碼。兩站後，我在棗山路站下車，又在那兒坐71路公交車。我終於到了什麼地方，站牌上面雖然寫著那個地方就是火車北站，周圍卻看不見什麼長得比較像火車站的建築，只有山、隧道、立交橋跟高速公路。我走著走著，背上的背包越來越重，手裏還有那件該死的外套和那把香蕉，結果到了那個神祕的火車北站。那個火車北站跟中國的很多新蓋的火車站一樣，不太像火車站，而比較像機場：候車的空間不分爲候車室而都在一塊兒，是一間巨大的大廳，從大廳可以經過檢票口走向站臺。車站門前是一片廣場，走向廣場的電梯還不開。電梯旁邊有牌子說“地鐵”，雖然貴陽還沒有地鐵。難怪大家都比較喜歡從原來的火車站坐車。

      火車站的屏幕上面一般寫著很多不同的火車，貴陽北站的屏幕上卻只有兩次車：我的（貴陽北->廣州南）還有下次一樣的車。

      <strong>2015-01-30 20:23:01 +0800<br />
      在中國第159天</strong><br />
      今天從桂林去了陽朔。出發以前，我還決定辦一些事情，其中最重要的大概是買去昆明的票。我很想過年的時候去泰國，但是現在買機票實在太貴了，所以我只好留在中國，找一些比較安靜的地方去過年。我就最害怕新年這幾天，全國都會很瘋狂。聽說那時候大都市變成鬼城：路上少有人走、飯店大多數都關門，並且這時候是一年以內最不舒服的天氣。我的一個朋友說，他去年過年的時候都呆在成都，而且一直在同一個宿舍。他說，當時只有德克士之類的連鎖飯店開門，宿舍誰都沒有，沒事情做，他只好勉強自己跟宿舍的保安和前臺服務員談話，但其實心裏還是很難過。我最最不喜歡沒有事情做，如果只有幾天，我還可以接受，或者給自己安排一些業餘活動，比如說去圖書館學習（但這樣需要學習的內容）、跟某個朋友見面（現在誰都去旅遊了，中國的美女都回家過年，成都只有那些不喜歡旅遊的人）。現在的安排如下：我先從桂林去昆明，然後從昆明到大理，大理到普洱，西雙版納，琅勃拉邦（寮國）。我希望在寮國過年不會太熱鬧，但其實在亞洲什麼都不能預料。

      前幾天都呆在桂林。桂林真的是個好地方。這個城市雖然很商業化，但是總算很安靜，住宿費也不貴（我住的青旅只要35塊錢）。交通比較方便，去哪兒差不多都可以坐公交車，大部分是雙層車，車票只要一塊（一層車2塊）。如果不是坐公交車，去很多地方還可以走路。到桂林之前，我還在貴陽呆了好幾天，這個城市的最明顯的缺點之一就是交通不好，一直在堵車。在貴州，我只成功去了三個地方，剩下來的地方都沒辦法去，因爲距離太大了；而在桂林，我每天都可以慢慢地去參觀。

      我還在桂林的時候，很多老外都跟我說過，桂林算是個好地方，但陽朔不僅比桂林小，而且還比桂林有趣、漂亮。剛到了這裏，我其實一點都不懂爲什麼這麼多人都這麼喜愛這裏；我只是發現，這個地方還比桂林商業化。到了我的青旅，我飛快地把我的行李放在房間裏，就出門去吃什麼簡單的飯。一出門就發現街對面的一家飯店賣水餃。進去那一家飯店我聽到兩個人好像在說波蘭語。看了一下他們的臉，誰知道其中一個是我們大學中文系的人！我其實不知道他現在在中國，因此突然在陽朔碰到他我覺得很驚訝。他們打算在陽朔吃陽朔的特色菜啤酒魚，只不過那一家實在太貴。我們只好走出去。我跟那個波茲南大學的人說，幾天以前我在桂林的青旅碰到了一個叫託馬斯的波蘭人還有他的來自俄羅斯的女朋友。我們走了一段路，便在路邊看到了一個女生；她也是老外，突然覺得她這張臉好熟悉，但是具體說不清是什麼人。他旁邊的人轉過身來，竟是那個名叫託馬斯的波蘭人！他們倆因爲剛在麥當勞吃了飯，所以沒有陪我們三個去找吃飯的地方。我們進了一家飯並在那裏吃了簡單的飯。我點的是一份水餃，15塊只能買8個！我跟老闆說，這個價錢太貴，15塊在成都就能吃飽。她卻跟我說，如果成都這麼便宜，誰也不攔我回成都吃飯，這裏不過是陽朔，這裏的物價很貴。這又怎麼可能，這麼小的鄉村怎麼還比成都這麼大的城市貴？1980年代，外國遊人才開始來到這裏，我估計那時候物價遠比現在的狀況便宜。怎麼辦？

      <strong>2015-02-01 16:40:09 +0800<br />
      在中國第161天</strong><br />
      我不喜歡這個地方。很有可能是因爲我的心情今天跟明天不算太好。我就有了這種非常想走的感覺。我本來要在廣西再呆一些時間，仔細參觀陽朔之後要跟一位江西朋友（亦稱江西醜女）去找一些我不太記得的女生。然而我對陽朔非常失望。應該是因爲現在是淡季，人雖然還是很多，但是風景沒有什麼特別的，其實跟桂林差不多。昨天我還在這裏的一家酒吧認識了一個波蘭男生。他來這裏是爲了學習中文，只不過中國還有什麼地方比陽朔更不適合學習中文？在這裏不僅僅誰都會說英文（至少會數字和自己所賣的產品的名稱），還有那種我不太喜歡的現象：你首先對一個中國人說中文，然後他用英文回覆。然後你堅持用中文跟他說話，他卻一直用英文。就算有一段時間會用中文，幾分鍾之後便會重新開始用英文。在這種情況下，哪兒有可能學好中文？還有，陽朔的酒吧顯然從來不關門，總是可以買得到啤酒、白酒、龍舌蘭、想買什麼就買什麼。這樣不光好不容易發財，而且還能用一個星期的時間完全破產。

      <strong>廣州，2015-02-06 20:33:55 +0800<br />
      在中國第166天</strong><br />
      四天以前我在陽朔租了一輛自行車，雖然那一天天氣不太好。我的車是山地車，沒有翼子版，而去我們要去的地方的道路上有很多泥土。我跟兩個來自杭州的美女一起去，其中只有一個出發去<span style="color: red;">第一次大規模中國旅遊</span>，我沒有帶小一點的包包，所以騎自行車的時候如果我突然覺得太熱，我沒有地方可以把我的外套塞進去。騎了十公里之後：一、我的外套和褲子上全都是泥土。二、每騎一兩公里都要停下來，脫下外套，等到不再覺得太熱。三、這樣騎我都好累了，到了還要爬山。那座山還不錯，名叫月亮山，山頂還有一個老太太給遊人賣明信片。她用很不標準的英文跟我們說了，她已經74歲，每天在這座山上賣明信片。因爲陽朔其實很少有人會說中文（甚至有些中國人不太會），因此對於她的英文能力我一點都沒有覺得驚訝。她的小冊裏面還有許多外國人給她寫下來的筆記<!--×××-->。

      我終於去了廣州。廣州的印象：物價沒有我想象那麼貴；地鐵雖方便卻總是人山人海；還有，不一定每個人都會說粵語。在中國大陸大部分城市，出租車司機只會說自己的方言，但我在廣州坐了一次出租車，司機是河南人，一句粵語都不會說。還有，我來廣州第一天，有個香港女生在Facebook給我發了好友申請。我看她的個人專頁發現我跟她沒有共同朋友。她說，她加我是因爲我臉書的另一個名字叫Aisin Gioro，那就是清朝皇家的姓。那一天，我剛剛來廣州不知道最好要吃什麼東西，所以去了一家點心店；點心店除了點心以外一般還有茶，因而我喝了不少鐵觀音。那一晚上我還喝了一瓶比較濃的烏龍茶，然後跟一個廣州朋友一起去了飯店，在那兒吃了很簡單的，但是超級貴的飯，喝了一杯18塊錢的奶茶。奶茶雖濃，我都喝完了，喝完之後便覺得頭有點暈。難怪夜裏直到6點我都睡不著。睡不著的時候我就跟那個香港女生聊天，她正好那一天晚上也睡不著。因爲看了一部有關於清朝的電視節目而想查一下世上還有沒有清朝皇家的後人。她自己是文天祥的後人，那個叫文天祥的人到底是誰我其實不太清楚，反正我還挺清楚她的英文名叫Carol M.，而我叫Karol M.，真巧！我當時有點想去香港看她，但她不願意跟我見面，而且去香港然後回桂林會很麻煩，所以終於我決定這次不要去。

      <strong>2015-02-07 15:45:21 +0800<br />
      在中國第167天</strong><br />
      昨晚玩得好開心。我跟一個廣州朋友、我沙發客（Couchsurfing）的主人、還有他的朋友去了一家酒吧，叫做Hangover，它的名字很對地形容它裏面的情況。出發之前，我們都在主人的家喝了一些酒。幾天以前，我在陽朔喝了有點太多，所以本來打算直到這次旅行結束都不要喝酒。但是我主人的朋友都在喝，我的廣州朋友也學大家一起喝，所以我終於也喝了一些。聚會有個女生來自福建，我讓她跟ALTF（超級可愛的臺灣朋友）說幾句閩南語。我本來覺得那個女生太吵，然而喝了點酒之後便覺得她其實也挺可愛的。她的普通話很標準，當我說話的時候她還糾正我的發音和聲調。我很喜歡她這一點。我現在最嫌我的發音不標準，很多中國人都聽不太懂。跟陌生人說話的時候我還努力說得標準一點，但我還是很清楚我的聲調其實是胡說八道。

      我們5點才回家。我一直都很清楚，我應該七點左右起牀，要不然就沒辦法趕得上9.50點的火車。爲了保證我早上不會起得太晚，我調了鬧鐘，讓它響好幾次。然而我沒有被鬧鐘吵醒，卻被睡在旁邊的一些人吵醒。我看了一眼手機，那時候已經8點了！我非常害怕以後無法離開廣州，而9號我還應該坐從桂林去昆明的火車。那時候我好慌張，認爲在廣州那麼大的城市一定不可能用一個半小時趕上火車。以後我發現，其實我住的地方和廣州南站是在同一條線。但是我偏選擇慌張。從廣州去桂林的票當然早就賣完了，我的票不能改簽，也不能退，因爲當時我的車已經開了。有一個中國人告訴我，我可以買一張票，廣州到下一站，然後到了桂林我就補償下一站到桂林的錢。我就這樣做。反正這次冐險一點都不好玩。

      我發現很多外國朋友放寒假的時候都會去比我更有趣的、更暖和的、更遠的地方旅遊。就像我在陽朔和桂林碰到的那個叫託馬斯的人及其女朋友好像要去泰國、馬來西亞、新加坡之類的。我出發的時候只買了第一張火車票，然後隨心所欲地徘徊。我的一個雲南朋友（長得很卡哇伊！）說她做旅遊的準備要麼都不做，要麼做得不認真。就像我在貴陽去哪兒都沒有準備好，去很遠很遠的地方還不退房，所以同時付兩個酒店的住宿費。我在貴陽認識了兩個男生，一個是澳大利亞人，另一個來自香港，十地歲時搬到澳大利亞。這兩個傢伙旅遊準備做得非常認真，從澳大利亞飛往香港開始，每一段路都安排得一清二楚；他們甚至提前買了全部火車票，因兩張票買不到而買了機票。每一段路都是往前走，不像我這樣亂。這樣既可以省錢又可以看見更多的景點。ALTF每次帶我去旅遊都會提前做“功課”，還叫我早點起牀，說“懶豬快起牀！懶豬快起牀！”

      <!-- Travels Small and Big. 186. Laos. Norwegians, Koreans, kittens and feeling of inferiority -->
      <strong>Luang Prabang, 2015-02-16 19:30:32 +0700<br />
      Day 4 in Laos</strong><br />
      I left China for the first time since August. I wasn't entirely sure if I should go there when I saw the price of the bus ticket (398 kuai!) but in the end I chose to go for it and now I'm here, in Luang Prabang. It's the second biggest city in Laos and the former capital. I don't know when the touristic boom actually started, but right now the city is absolutely full of white (and slightly yellow) tourists from all around the world, mostly England, Germany, Canada (all of them from Québec,) France and Korea.

      On Saturday I went to the local library with a Chinese woman I met on the bus. (She is originally from Chengdu, and so old she didn't want to tell me her age.) I've read about the library before on TripAdvisor, and it was really a pleasant experience. After several months in China, where all that matters for most people is money and not losing one's face in front of your friends/enemies/family/society, I finally came to a place where people are actually nice to each other. In the library reading room, there was a group of young people around my age who were sitting and making flowers from plasticine. No Chinese child would ever have time to do something like this, not to mention a teenager. I donated a few dollars to charity, helping buy a book and supporting the building of a toilet somewhere deep in the country.

      Then happened something that changed my view on compassion and helping others. We found a kitten lying in the shadow

      Yesterday I went out to the night market and met some Norwegians. They were absolutely delighted to meet a Polish person who never even went to Norway, and yet could speak some, however broken, Norwegian. They interviewed me in Norwegian, asking questions like &ldquo;Have you ever been to Norway?&rdquo; (Nope, way too expensive.) or &ldquo;Have you watched any Norwegian TV shows?&rdquo; (Only Ylvis, but with English subtitles.) Then they moved on to their hotel and sat there, drinking cold Beerlao, talking loudly and happily in their majestic language. There were also some Swedes, and even I could understand a few words from their language. I realized I often feel inferior when I'm with Nordic people. They sat there, tall, strong and beautiful, like half-gods. They were probably also much richer than me, so they could probably afford getting drunk with cold Beerlao, lao whisky or lao lao at least ten times a day and then bringing two hookers to their private rooms in expensive hotels. At the same time, I'm staying in the cheapest backpacker hostel in town, sharing a dorm with nine other backpackers. The mattresses are barely softer than wood, there is no AC (not that we need any AC in winter,) and for the whole hostel there is just one or two showers. I sometimes wish I were born Norwegian, but then again, I had enough good karma to meet the Dharma&mdash;isn't it worth way more than a cosy life in Norway?

      <strong>2015-02-17 02:03:10 +0700<br />
      Day 5 in Laos</strong><br />
      Another random meeting that sort of changed my life. I went to Utopia, a popular bar for foreigners in Luang Prabang, where I sat with a Malaysian, a Korean and a Filipina. I told everyone that animal scientists can make good money on insemination of cows. I described the process of insemination. It's pretty disgusting, because you have to put your hand up to the armpit in the cow's anus, and it of course ends in putting semen inside the cow's vagina. Then the Korean asked: "But if you put cement in the cow's vagina, doesn't it die? Don't you have mercy for the animals???"

      After that lovely one beer in Utopia, I went to the bowling alley with some Chinese. One of them actually spoke better English than Chinese, as he was born and raised in Canada, while another one spoke with a slight Beijing accent, which I don't really understand too well. When the bowling alley filled up with people (human-mountain, human-sea) I moved to some random table where there were some local people. Then one of them spoke to me and it turned out he could speak Polish. He had studied construction engineering in Łódź and now owns a big construction company in Vientiane, and invited me to come and visit him.

      <strong>2015-02-20 21:50:41 +0700<br />
      Day 8 in Laos</strong><br />
      '''Vientiane.''' It takes 12 hours by bus from Luang Prabang to get here, which is more or less riding from sunrise till sunset. Considering road conditions in Lao PDR, it's not a very pleasant journey. In regions where they managed to put some sort of asphalt on the roads, at least you don't have to fly up and down with every turbulence, but the roads are still curvy (even curvier than the curviest girls I've met in my life,) so every ten seconds you get thrown left and right, and so on. This is hardly made more pleasant by the scorching heat, but I do admit our coach was air-conditioned, so I only started sweating like crazy when I got off. After arriving at the bus station in Vientiane, I had to get to the city centre by ''tuk-tuk''. My Laotian friend sent me the name of the place I had to go, but I don't think the tuk-tuk driver really knew where it was. He just let me get off somewhere, took 20,000 kip from me and said &ldquo;Yes, yes, Mercure Hotel.&rdquo;

      Then I got off and tried to walk my way, but I didn't really know which way to go. Then, when I was walking next to a very expensive and extravagant car parked in the street, some foreigner asked me if I knew what the make of the car was. I told him I didn't have an idea. The foreigner was there with two blondes, and they looked so Slavic that I asked them in Polish if they were from Poland. They did understand, but they turned out to be Russian. They all live in Thailand and only came to Vientiane to get a new visa. They checked the way to Mercure Hotel for me, and after about 40 minutes of wandering, with my overweight backpack on my back and my winter jacket in my hand, I somehow managed to get to our destination. On the way there we found another Russian guy, and we also found out we were walking in the opposite direction for quite a while.

      My Laotian friend turned out to be sitting in a sushi restaurant next to Mekhong river with his friends, but my Russians didn't want to join them, so I went to sit with the Russians in the dry riverbed of Mekhong. Thailand turned out to be on the other side of the river. It was probably my first ever picnic in February, and definitely never before could I just sit outside in a winter night wearing just summer clothes. Laos is known for its Beerlao, and sooner or later every way you walk takes you to a nice bar or at least a shop selling cool Beerlao for 10,000 kip. Therefore the Russians and I ended up drinking cold Beerlao. Around eleven we said goodbye and I went to some local bar with my Laotian friend. The bar was full of people, a band was playing live music in Lao and English, and the stage was decorated with New Year wishes in Chinese (春聯 chun1lian2.)

      There were a few Laotian girls dressed in red, speaking English and drinking Sex on the Beach, and there were also some Laotian girls dressed in other colors, not drinking Sex on the Beach and not speaking any English at all. I ended up riding a motorbike with two Laotians (one dressed in red and the other just drunk) in search of accomodation at 4 a.m. I saw ladyboys for the first time in my life, and the girl were just asking them for directions. In the bar, my shorts tore, so now I can only wear those Laotian traditional trousers that don't even have any pockets.

      Once you come to Asia, you realize English could never be, and will never be, a means of global communication. However, I think they could do quite well with some Esperanto.

      <span style="color: #070;">
      In the next semester I'm planning to get a legal library card, so that I can go to the library every day and study. For the upcoming months, I've scheduled a lot of Korean and Esperanto. I had some tough time with the Koreans in Chengdu, but here in Laos I also met dozens of Koreans who were very nice and spoke either very good English, very good Chinese, or both. I think it might be pretty easy to get Korean practice in the dorms, but with Esperanto it may be a bit more tricky. So I'm also going to buy a microphone and Skype with Esperantists. And maybe the best way would be to find Esperantists from Korea&hellip;
      &</span>

      When I go back, I will also start cooking some meals by myself. It may not necessarily be cheaper than eating out in Chengdu, but then again&mdash;aren't the advantages of cooking by oneself obvious?

      <strong>2015-02-21 23:48:47 +0700<br />
      Day 9 in Laos</strong><br />
      I'm actually pretty tired after walking all day, but I also feel quite happy about something. Today in a café I met two Koreans who could barely speak any English and no Chinese at all. That was a big change, because all of the Koreans I've met in China can speak at least understandable Chinese, and some are also quite good at English. But with these, I had no other way out of communication problems than checking the dictionary or trying to explain stuff in my broken Korean. The one I remember better is called Jiyeong, she's twenty-eight in Western years (and looks twenty-two,) and she's really cute. Unfortunately, she only came to Laos for 6 days, and she's probably already home by now.

      There were times in Chengdu when I could have a brief conversation, but it was always about some trivial topics, like eating rice, and most of these were also a bit forced. If I couldn't express my thoughts in Korean, I always switched to Chinese. Also, in China I didn't really get to talk to Koreans for too long. The only time I managed to hold a conversation for longer than half an hour was when I went to WOW and met that girl called Yena, but then everyone was very drunk, and then the contact somehow broke. *** link ***

      I now really want to go to Seoul. The girls told me if I went to Seoul, we could drink alcohol every day. During the three hours that I spent with them, Jiyeong drank two small bottles of Beerlao, and that was by daytime. How much could she drink in one night? One bottle of ''soju'', she said. But then her friend corrected her, saying in English &ldquo;liar&rdquo;. She can drink two bottles of soju, then black out (BTW. in German it's called ''Absturz'', and in Austria you can also say ''Meier gehen'', and that refers to some ski jumper) and go on drinking when she wakes up.

      Watching my mind: Yesterday I was feeling homesick and wanted to go to back to China and go on living my ordinary life. Then I meditated and didn't feel homesick anymore. Today I don't feel homesick at all, instead I don't want to go back to China, and I'd rather stay in Laos for a bit longer and try to practise my spoken Korean as often as possible. I'm not going to change any further plans right now. I'd better wait with that.

      <strong>2015-02-23 12:45:17 +0800<br />
      Day 11 in Laos</strong><br />
      '''Vang Vieng.''' I heard there is some TV programme in Korea about this town, and due to this fact, there are more Koreans here than in Korea. I heard many stories about an activity in VV called tubing. It's more or less like this: you take an inner tube (the inner part of a car tire or whatever,) which you can rent for 55,000 kip (+60,000 deposit) in the town. Then a tuk-tuk takes you to the river where you get on the water. There are four bigger bars along the river and one place that also sells beer. It's pretty obvious that most fans of tubing are Westerners. There were also some Koreans floating on the river, but not a single Asian in any of the bars, and all Chinese people preferred kayaking or even motor boats. I didn't really fancy getting drunk by daylight in a bar where there weren't even any Koreans, so I only went ashore a few times to take pictures.

      I never actually expected I would end up swimming in a river, and especially not during winter holiday, not to mention in Laos. The current was quite slow, so most of the time I had to paddle with my arms, and in some parts there were rocks on the bottom, but otherwise it was quite a lot of fun. Near the end I joined a group of Koreans (one of them being actually undercover Aussie) and when we got back to town, we went for Korean BBQ (불고기).

      In the evening I decided to go to Sakura Bar (Motto: Drink Triple &bull; See Double &bull; Act Single.) My plan was to chat up some Koreans. I originally wanted to find some pretty Korean girls walking in more or less the same direction as me, and then ask them: 실례합니다, 사쿠라 술집에 가는 길 좀 가르쳐 주시겠어요? However, before I found any suitable Koreans, I already saw the bar, so it would be a bit fishy if I asked for directions. In Sakura there were of course numerous Westerners, but there were also a few groups of pretty Koreans. One girl from near Seoul that I met in Vientiane told me that the Korean holidays are already over, so everyone will soon be going back. That means I probably came here in the last days of the Korean invasion, just in time to learn that some Koreans actually consider me to be quite handsome (sic) and to have my clothes soaked in Laotian beer by some Korean dickhead. Then all the Koreans went home, riding rented bicycles, and I set off for my guesthouse. After half an hour of walking some roads that I didn't even recognize I ended up at the entrance to the forest. Then I went back, and I found some small Buddhist temple. I took a ground mat and slept for maybe two hours, then I went to find my guesthouse again.

      Tomorrow I'm going back to Luang Prabang, and then I'll have to survive another journey on Laotian mountain roads to go back to China.

      <!-- Travels Small and Big. 187. Back to China. Recollection. Hitchiking -->
      <strong>Kunming, 2015-03-01 01:04:39 +0800<br />
      Day 4 (197) in China</strong><br />
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: bold;">Back to China.</span> I came from Luang Prabang in Laos to Jinghong by bus, then from Jinghong to Kunming by car, with a friend that I met on the bus. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately) I forgot to take my camera bag from the friend's car before she set off for a different destination. So now I cannot really go anywhere by train or by plane, or stay in hotels.

      <span class="china">Chengdu</span> => <span class="china">Guiyang</span> => <span class="china">Guilin</span> => <span class="china">Yangshuo</span> => <span class="china">Guangzhou</span> => <span class="china">Guilin</span> => <span class="china">Kunming</span> => <span class="laos">Luang Prabang</span> => <span class="laos">Vientiane</span> => <span class="laos">Vang Vieng</span> => <span class="laos">Luang Prabang</span> => <span class="china">Jinghong</span> => <span class="china">Kunming</span>.

      If you have the choice of staying in China or going abroad during winter holidays, I would strongly advise to go abroad. I only went to Laos this time, but it was much warmer, cheaper, and more fun than most places I visited in China.

      === Places or activities I liked on this trip: ===
      # Tianhetan 天河潭, Guiyang, Guizhou province
      # Xiangbishan 象鼻山公園, Guilin, Guangxi autonomous region
      # Kouangsi Waterfalls, Luang Prabang, Laos
      # Tubing in Vang Vieng, Laos
      # Folded Brocade Hill 疊彩山, Guilin, Guangxi autonomous region
      # Guangzhou City Library, Guangzhou, Guangdong province

      === Places you I regret ever going to: ===
      ==== Huangguoshu Waterfall 黃果樹瀑布, near Anshun, Guizhou province ====
      So famous that many Chinese people may have never heard of Anshun or Guizhou province, but definitely have heard of the biggest waterfall in Asia, Huangguoshu. I actually didn't see the waterfall itself. I only reached the parking lot near the waterfall. There you have to buy ridiculously overpriced tickets (160 yuan/80 yuan with a student card,) and it's just to enter the scenic area. I actually went there in low season, where there was hardly anyone going in or out.

      From the parking lot it's still several kilometers to go to the waterfall. You can choose to go by public bus for 2 yuan, but in low season there are very few buses and when we arrived, there were no buses anymore. Another choice is to take the sightseeing bus for 50 yuan/person, which seems crazy after you have just spent 160 yuan for the entrance ticket. You can also take a cab, but cabs around the waterfall are not regular cabs. They are even more expensive than the sightseeing bus.

      '''Another drawback:''' The waterfall is among China's best-known attractions, which means that in high season there are more Chinese tourists than there are trees in the forest surrounding the waterfall. The parking area looked like it was big enough for at least twenty coaches. If you have to visit Huangguoshu Waterfall, go there on weekdays. If you're departing from Guiyang, you have to take the earliest morning train to Anshun, otherwise you won't get to the scenic area on time.

      ==== Yangshuo 陽朔, Guilin, Guangxi autonomous region ====
      Yangshuo was discovered by Western backpackers and fans of rock climbing in the 1980s. I reckon at that time it must have been ridiculously cheap and peaceful. Many foreigners told me that Yangshuo was <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">their place on Earth</span>, that they only went there for a few days and stayed for several months instead. It was supposed to be very small, for Chinese standards. Just about an hour from Guilin, it's a place you have to go if you visit Guilin.

      My vision: '''Tourist trap.''' It's about as authentic and cheap as Zakopane. In Yangshuo, even taxi drivers and shop assistants can speak at least some English, and the overall level of English is about 150% above average. Unfortunately, in most of the town food prices also don't bring to mind other places in China.

      <strong>2015-03-02 10:57:21 +0800<br />
      Day 5 (198) in China</strong><br />
      <span style="font-variant: small-caps; font-weight: bold;">Hitchhiking in China.</span> I heard many relations from people who managed to hitchhike in China, even for longer distances. I heard if you're standing on the right spot, you shouldn't have to wait more than around five minutes. I'm going to travel around 900 km from Kunming to Chengdu. I left my Polish friend's place around 7.30 in the morning and walked to the place where I assumed I could catch a ride, at least to G5 highway, where I could probably catch a ride to somewhere in Sichuan. I stood there for about 30 minutes, then some guard in uniform gestured to me that it wasn't the right way. Then some girl about my age tried to explain to me in broken English that I should take the bus 151 to the bus station and I can <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">buy tickets for my bus</span> there.

      Then I decided I was standing in the wrong place and that I should probably get to the highway *收費站*. I walked around 50m and tried to get a cab. Then some elderly man stopped and asked me where I wanted to go. I said, Sichuan. He said he could take me to the highway for 60 yuan (!). I told him I was going to take a cab, and anyway, I wasn't interested in <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">paying for my ride.</span> In the end, he took me to the highway entrance (G56 this time) for 30 yuan. There I stood for several minutes with a sign saying ''Chengdu'', but I only saw three cars with Sichuanese numbers. Then I decided I wouldn't find any car going to Sichuan, so I wrote ''Zhaotong, Chengdu''. Within two minutes, a car stopped and the driver said he was going to Zhaotong. I asked if he wanted any money for the ride and he said it was free. So now I'm still on the way. It should take about five hours and I'm going to stay overnight in Zhaotong.

      I made a vow not to drink any alcohol until March, 8th to give my liver a rest after Laos.

      <strong>Chengdu, 2015-03-28 17:22:51 +0800<br />
      Dzień 31 (224) w Chinach</strong><br />

      <span class="strsm">189. Co się wydarzyło w Klubie Na Górze?<br />
      Wywiad Osoby Pierwszej z Osobą Drugą</span>

      <span class="person1">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Pierwsza:</span> Powiedz mi, co się wczoraj działo.</span>

      <span class="person2">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Druga:</span> Powinieneś raczej spytać, co się '''nie''' działo. Najpierw <span style="letter-spacing: 0.16em;">poszłem</span> do „1855”. Było to gdzieś o jedenastej.</span>

      <span class="person1">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Pierwsza:</span> Czy były jakieś fajne dziunie?</span>

      <span class="person2">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Druga:</span> Mhm. Były tam nasze przyjaciółki, Cycata (Piękny Nefryt Wen), która nadal jest cycata, i Zielonowłosa (Szlachetny Klejnot Liu), która już nie jest zielonowłosa, i nie tańczy już w czarnym, wełnianym płaszczu, tak jak owego pamiętnego (?&hellip;) wieczoru, kiedyśmy je poznali.</span>

      <span class="person1">„Myślę, że to, że zapisujesz nazwiska Chińczyków na drugim miejscu odzwierciedla twój europocentryczny obraz świata, który nie przystoi sinologowi.”</span>

      <!-- TU MUSIMY PIERDOLNĄĆ JAKIŚ FRAZES -->
      <span class="person1">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Pierwsza:</span> W Chinach ''fazhan'' następuje bardzo szybko. Stare chłopskie chaty z dnia na dzień zrównuje się tu z ziemią, by równie szybko wyrosły na ich miejscu apartamentowce i drapacze chmur. Stylówy dziewcząt również podążają za tym samym <span style="letter-spacing: 0.16em;">trądem</span>.

      <span class="person2">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Druga:</span> Spotkałem tam też Caystal, tę uroczą dziewczynę, którą zawsze można znaleźć w „1855”.</span>

      <span class="person1">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Pierwsza:</span> O, to ona naprawdę ma na imię Caystal. Myślałem, że chcesz napisać „Crystal” i coś ci się popieprzyło.</span>

      <span class="person2">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Druga:</span> Przeprowadziłem z nią poważną rozmowę o życiu i całej reszcie. Powiedziałem jej, że postanowiłem brać z niej przykład, gdyż uważam, że odkryła receptę na szczęście.</span>

      <span class="person1">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Pierwsza:</span> Czy możesz zdradzić miastu i światu receptę na szczęście Caystal?</span>

      <span class="person2">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Druga</span> Caystal ma 16 lat. Jak na tak młodą kobietę, wykazuje się niezwykłą dojrzałością i zdecydowaniem. Zdecydowanie unika chodzenia do liceum, i z dojrzałością, godną co najmniej 18-latki, realizuje się na chengduskiej scenie klubowej. Powiedziałem jej, że wziąłem już urlop dziekański. Kiedy spytałem ją, jak widzi swoją przyszłość zawodową z wykształceniem gimnazjalnym, odpowiedziała mi utartym frazesem: 生得好不如嫁得好, „lepiej dobrze wyjść za mąż, niż urodzić się w dobrej rodzinie”. Zauważyłem też, że dłonie Caystal są bardzo suche i zniszczone. Powiedziała mi, że to alergia skórna, ale szczerze mówiąc, mam niejasne podejrzenia, że dolegliwość ta może być wywołana przez środki odurzające. Ostatnio przeczytałem gimnazjalny bestseller ''My, dzieci z dworca ZOO''. Skojarzenie z postacią Christiny F. nasuwa się samo, z tym tylko wyjątkiem, że Caystal, zamiast do dyskoteki „Sound” i chrześcijańskiej wspólnoty „Haus der Mitte” chodzi do klubu „1855”.</span>

      <span class="person1">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Pierwsza:</span> Czy odbyły się tego wieczoru jakieś wyszukane występy artystyczne?</span>

      <span class="person2">
      <span class="strsm">Osoba Druga:</span> Nic w tak złym guście, jak ta laska z galanterią w kształcie bananów japońskich ostatnim razem. Było takich czworo obcokrajowców, troje dziewcząt i jeden młodzian. Pojawiali się na scenie dwukrotnie w czasie mojego pobytu w klubie. Za pierwszym razem dziewczęta odziane były bardzo skąpo, do tego stopnia, że z kostiumów wychodziły im fragmenty majtek i pośladków, zaś przy drugim występie stylizowani byli na czarnych raperów z przedmieść Detroit, Michigan. Kiedy tylko na nich spojrzałem, wiedziałem, że pochodzą z któregoś z krajów dawnego Związku Sowieckiego. Przeczucie mnie nie myliło. Kiedy spotkałem ich przy tylnym wyjściu z lokalu, nie spytali nawet, czy mówię w ich języku &mdash; od razu powiedzieli ''priwiet''. Zastanawiałem się jeszcze, czy są z Rosji, czy z Ukrainy, ale jak się okazało, byli i stąd, i stamtąd. W przerwach pomiędzy ich występami na parkiet wychodził konferansjer i można było wylosować maskotki. Traf chciał, że dużą maskotkę wylosowała akurat nasza przyjaciółka, Cycata. Potem spiła się do nieprzytomności Rémy Martinem z wodą sodową (która zawiera źródło fenyloalaniny i nie może być spożywana przez osoby chore na fenyloketonurię). Potem ta artystka od siedmiu boleści, która ostatnio paradowała z galanterią w kształcie bananów japońskich, wyszła na scenę w bardzo skąpym stroju, za to z wielką gaśnicą.</span>

      <hr />

      Myślę, że powinniśmy wciagnąć się w internet i znaleźć jakieś ciekawe strony do czytania.

      Na przykład, jakie?

      No, powiedzmy, strony o życiu w Azji.

      Taaa, albo blogi o Chinach, na których piszą, że w Chinach jest dużo ludzi i Wielki Mur, a mieszkańcy jedzą ryż pałeczkami.

      <strong>Chengdu, 2015-03-14 13:36:48 +0800<br />
      Dzień 17 (210) w Chinach</strong><br />
      W którymś momencie w Chengdu przestało być <span style="color: #090;">zimno jak skurczysyn</span> i kubek z herbatą już nie przymarza mi do biurka. Bez roweru niewiele jednak mam pożytku z pięknej wiosennej pogody i któregoś dnia nogi same zaprowadziły mnie do baru. Powróciłem więc do erasmusowego stylu życia i wszystko wskazuje na to, że tak już zostanie. Po pierwszym semestrze bezwstydnego pobierania stypendium na rozbijanie się trzydziestometrowymi limuzynami od popijawy do popijawy i barłożenie w narkomańskich melinach, postanowiłem zakasać rękawy i uczciwie wziąć się do nauki.

      Żeby jakoś osłodzić sobie trudy zdobywania wiedzy, powróciłem również do nauki języka koreańskiego. Ponadto, po wizycie w Laosie jeszcze głębiej utwierdziłem się w przekonaniu, że język angielski nigdy nie był, nie jest i nigdy nie będzie prawdziwą ''linguą francą'', to jest <span style="color: #090;">uniwersalnym narzędziem porozumienia między narodami świata</span>, i że tylko Esperanto może uratować ludzkość. Do tego staram się robić codziennie pokłony, ale nie za dużo, żeby nie uszkodzić kolan. Dodajmy jeszcze do tego regularne czytanie ''e-książek'' i otrzymamy gotową receptę na przyjemne i produktywne spędzenie mego drugiego i ostatniego semestru na Uniwersytecie Syczuańskim (którego, jak już wspomniałem w polskojęzycznej noci [[Blog:Elefanto/181. China day 106. O kabalistyce i Australijczykach|181.]], z przyczyn osobistych wolę nie nazywać Swoją Uczelnią). Faktycznie, plan ów jest w teorii całkiem doskonały.

      A potem pojawiły się Koreanki i wszystko było tak jak dawniej. Ale po kolei.

      Minionej niedzieli, to jest 8 marca, w Międzynarodowy Dzień Kobiet, który jest w Chinach bardziej czymś w stylu Dnia Kobiet Zamężnych (bo nazywa się 婦女節, a 婦女 to kobieta zamężna), poszedłem z kumplem po kieliszku, Szymonem zwanym Piotrem, do całodobowego po jedno piwko, może dwa, aby odprężyć się po trudach przygotowań do kontynuacji nauki. W sklepie natrafiłem na mojego legalnego współlokatora, mieszkańca Las Vegas o imieniu Brent (w odróżnieniu od nielegalnego współlokatora z Kalifornii, który waletował w moim pokoju przez 6 tygodni w zeszłym roku) z jeszcze kimśtam. Spojrzał na moją reklamówkę z trzema butelkami 勁酒, po czym zadał jakieś mądre pytanie w stylu ''Are you guys drinking?'', a ja mu na to, że <span style="color: #090;">''of course not, have you ever seen a Polish person drinking alcohol?''</span>

      Brent przyjechał do Chengdu na stypendium rządu chińskiego, aby uczyć się języka chińskiego. Jako stypendysta ma zapewniony darmowy nocleg w pokoju dwuoosobowym w akademiku, ale ponieważ jak każdy co bardziej przedsiębiorczy Amerykanin dorabia na czarno jako biały nauczyciel języka amerykańskiego, <span style="color: #090;">wynajął sobie penthouse na pobliskim drapaczu chmur</span> i regularnie urządza tam <span style="color: #900;">tańce, hulanki i swawole</span>, na które nigdy mnie nie zaprasza. Dlatego też przez większą część semestru zimowego mieszkałem sam i mogłem sprowadzać sobie na noc przystojnych kolesi i wciągać koks bez strachu przed przypałem.

      Z powodu pewnej historii z Koreanką z pokoju obok, do niedawna mieliśmy tylko jeden klucz do pokoju, a drugi pojechał do Korei, w związku z tym Brent nie mógł się oficjalnie wyprowadzić. Zapytał mnie za to, czy mógłby w moim pokoju mieszkać pewien Japończyk. Stwierdziłem, że w sumie i tak nie mam szczególnie wiele do gadania, więc się zgodziłem. Brent stwierdził, że należałoby Japończyka dla hecy upić, ale ów wysączył tylko pół puszki Kirina i więcej nie chciał.

      Potem przygruchaliśmy sobie z korytarza osiem sympatycznych Koreanek, pojechaliśmy na dwa skutery do całodobowego, kupiliśmy jakąś absurdalną ilość napojów wyskokowych i urządziliśmy sobie <span style="color: #090;">małą pijatykę w pokoju 315</span>. Stwierdziłem potem, że wszystko się zgadza &mdash; z okazji 8 marca balowaliśmy z 8 kobietami do godziny trzeciej. Nauczyliśmy Koreanki mówić ''aśenajebałam''. Wszystkie wstały na 8.30, choć były podobno bardzo zmęczone.

      Mam więc teraz nielegalnego współlokatora Japończyka o imieniu Czarne Drzewo. Jest to współlokator raczej bezproblemowy. O 8.20 wychodzi na zajęcia, o 12.30 wraca z zajęć, po czym <span style="color: #090;">do 22 siedzi w pokoju, grając na PS Vita, i idzie spać</span>. Raz z polskim kumplem po kieliszku, Szymonem zwanym Piotrem, spytaliśmy go, czy może zechciałby udać się z nami na dach i wypić jedno piwko. Wyszedł z nami na dach. Potem przygruchaliśmy sobie jeszcze cztery Koreanki i w rezultacie czegośtam stopniowo trafiliśmy do Only, już bez Koreanek, za to z germanowłoskim kumplem po kieliszku, Steffenem zwanym Steffenem.

      Chodziliśmy po całym klubie, ale nie było tam żadnej sympatycznej Chinki, która zechciałaby nas zaprosić do swojego stolika. Kiedy już staliśmy przy szatni i mieliśmy odzyskać swoje <span style="color: #090;">okrycia wierzchnie</span>, zjawiła się jakaś młoda, uśmiechnięta Chineczka. Upewniwszy się, iż mówimy trochę po chińsku, spytała, czy może zechcielibyśmy dać się zaprosić do stolika na szklankę jakiegoś napoju. Potem okazało się, <span style="color: #090;">że</span> większość gości przy stole jest Kochająca Inaczej. Zostaliśmy zmuszeni do gry <span style="color: #090;">w</span> kości na alkohol. Kiedy jeszcze byliśmy w stanie chodzić, ulotniliśmy <span style="color: #090;">się</span> z lokalu.

      Polski kumpel po kieliszku, <span style="color: #090;">Szymon zwany Piotrem</span>, postanowił udać się do akademika i, docelowo, na zajęcia. Ja zaś, wraz z germanowłoskim kumplem po kieliszku, Steffenem zwanym Steffenem, poszedłem do jednej z pobliskich restauracji nocnych na pierogi ''won-ton'' w zupie. Nie zdążyliśmy nawet usiąść, a już zostaliśmy zaproszeni do zajęcia miejsc przy stole jakichś obcych Chińczyków. Zadawali wszystkie te same pytania, co zawsze, na które staraliśmy się im łamaną chińszczyzną odpowiedzieć. Zachęcali nas również do spożywania ich alkoholi.

      Był tam też jeden facet, który gadał coś do jednej, całkiem niebrzydkiej Chinki, i próbował złożyć na jej ustach pocałunek, ale ona nie dawała mu się przekonać. Powiedziała mi potem, że z zawodu jest tancerką w „傾城&bull;娛樂匯”, tym podejrzanym klubie, który mieści się nad „7-Eleven”, i do którego zawsze przyjeżdża najwięcej BMW, Mercedesów i Porsche. Zawsze są one w kolorze białym, i zawsze wysiadają z nich biznesmeni w garniturach szytych na miarę, w wieku około 40 lat. Dziewczyny, pracujące w tym klubie &mdash; bądź to w charakterze barmanek, bądź tancerek, bądź Budda Wie Jakim &mdash; przed, po i w trakcie pracy spożywają posiłki właśnie w naszym „7-Eleven”, dzięki temu mieliśmy okazję poznać wiele z nich, kiedy w poprzednim semestrze chadzaliśmy tam z Adrianem, Minami i tym Japończykiem, którego imienia nie pomnę, na Kiriny.

      Raz zaczepiłem przed klubem dwie dziewczyny, które miały już chyba 18 lat. Były olśniewająco piękne i dobrze ubrane. Spytałem, co tu robią. Odparły, że są w robocie, pracują w tym klubie, o, tam, nad „7-Eleven”, i że właśnie odprowadzają klienta do samochodu. Faktycznie, przed wielkim, błyszczącym białym samochodem stały nie tylko Olśniewająco Piękne Chinki, lecz również cała gromada kelnerów, ochroniarzy, kucharzy i barmanów, uroczyście żegnających Szanownego Gościa. Na przednich siedzeniach samochodu, którego marka nie jest ważna, ale który pewnie kosztował wystarczająco dużo, żeby przychód z jego sprzedaży móc umieścić na lokacie w Amber Gold i nie musieć pracować do końca życia, siedzieli szofer i jego nienagannie odziany biznesmen.

      Trzyipółlitrowy silnik zapalił od razu &mdash; ''tukutuku-wruuum, wruuum''. Zapłonęły ksenony, i szofer pewnie wyjechał spomiędzy gromady białych samochodów, wartych w sumie więcej, niż budżet województwa zachodniopomorskiego. Jeden z pracowników, wykonujących bliżej nieokreślony zawód, wręczył każdej z dziewczyn po 300 juanów, tyle samo również włożył do swojej kieszeni. Jako że minimalna dniówka w Chengdu wynosi jakieś 70 juanów, nie miałem wątpliwości, że dziewczyny te musiały się Szanownemu Klientowi w szczególny sposób przypodobać.

      Kiedy później opowiadałem tę historię innym dziewczynom, pracującym w tym klubie, one mówiły, że wszystko źle zrozumiałem. Że może ten pan w samochodzie był ich wujkiem, a przecież wujkowie oraz inni członkowie rodziny często dają młodzieży pieniądze, nawet jeśli zdają sobie sprawę, że latorośl potrafi przebalować całą swoją wypłatę w ciągu trzech dni. (A spotykałem takich ludzi, nawet w Poznaniu). W pewnym momencie byłem już gotów uwierzyć, że może ten tajemniczy klub jest rzeczywiście po prostu szczególnie ciekawym miejscem do spożywania trunków, w którym, dla umilenia klientom czasu, tańczy dużo młodych, ładnych, skąpo odzianych dziewczyn. Germanoitalski kumpel po kieliszku, Steffen zwany Steffenem, mówił jednak, że raz zdarzyło mu się pójść tam ze znajomym Chińczykiem. Mówił, że jest dużo młodych, ładnych, skąpo ubranych dziewczyn, które zaczepiają klientów, prosząc o zakup napojów. Właśnie ''to'' wzbudziło moje podejrzenia &mdash; wszak w ''normalnym'' układzie dziewczyny zaczepiają białych głównie po to, aby spytać, czy ci nie chcieliby może dać się zaprosić.

      Chcę do Korei. Może mieć to jakiś związek z tym, że nasz akademik różni się w tej chwili od statystycznego akademika w Korei chyba tylko prędkością internetu. Nawet kuchenka mikrofalowa w naszym piętrze ma wszystkie napisy po koreańsku.

      Dzień 22 (215) w Chinach</strong><br />
      Poszedłem wczoraj z polskim kumplem po kieliszku, Szymonem zwanym Piotrem, na piwo do „7-Eleven”. Postanowiliśmy pójść coś zjeść, a że po godzinie 21 normalne restauracje są już zamknięte, wybór padł na niewielką budkę z ''maocai'' 冒菜, syczuańską potrawą złożoną z obgotowanych na poczekaniu warzyw w zalewie z ostrej papryki i glutaminianu monosodowego<ref>Za moich czasów nazywało się to „glutaminian sodu”.</ref>. Przy stoliku obok nas siedziały jakieś ''typiary'' w wieku lat siedemnastu. Jak się okazało, spożywały one tam właśnie kolację z zamiarem udania się następnie do klubu „1855”. Jako że przed klubem (nawet przed jego tylnymi drzwiami) zawsze stoi ochroniarz w hełmie Obergruppenführera, i ponieważ lokal ten zlokalizowany jest dokładnie na trasie „7-Eleven”<=>akademik, więc zawsze przechodzę tamtędy objuczony itemami jak objuczony wielbłąd, nigdy nie wpadłem na ten dziki pomysł, by pójść do tego klubu na balety. Ponieważ jednak zostaliśmy tam zaproszeni, zaszliśmy na chwilkę i wyszliśmy dopiero bardzo późnym wieczorem.

      Najpierw poznałem tam szesnastolatkę o dźwięcznym (jakkolwiek bezsensownym) angielskim imieniu Caystal. Zaczepiłem ją dla hecy, gdy, poprawiając bluzkę podwiniętą pod cyce, cykała sobie foteczki przed lustrem koło toalet. Dziewczę to zaprzestało nauki po pierwszym semestrze liceum, a że oferty zatrudnienia w Chengdu dla dziewcząt z wykształceniem gimnazjalnym nie były dla niej wystarczająco atrakcyjne, chwilowo nie podjęła jeszcze żadnej pracy i strasznie jej się samej w domu nudzi. Dlatego też codziennie chodzi do „1855”, upija się Rémy Martinem i tańczy do utraty tchu. Napisałem jej później, że nic dziwnego, że nie spodobało jej się w liceum. Caystal ma zaledwie 155 cm wzrostu, a liceum w języku chińskim nazywa się ''gaozhong'' 高中, dosłownie „wysoka szkoła średnia”. “難怪你沒有讀高中。你這個個子只能讀矮中。” &mdash; „z twoim wzrostem mogłabyś uczęszczać tylko do niskiej szkoły średniej”.

      Potem pojawiła się całkiem niebrzydka, i dużo wyższa od Caystal, Chinka z tlenionym włosiem. Powiedziała mi, że ma na imię Nana 娜娜 (to właściwie nie znaczy absolutnie nic), i że jej stary jest wprawdzie z Syczuanu, ale jej matka jest jakoby Japonką. Faktycznie, twarz jej nie wykazywała syczuańskich cech antropologicznych. Nana miała już dość tęgo w czubie, ale mimo to szczodrze polała sobie i mnie czyściutkiego Rémy'ego Martina i spytała, czy nie chciałbym może zostać jej chłopakiem. Powiedziałem jej, że jestem zaszczycony, ale przed wydaniem ostatycznego werdyktu w tej sprawie wolałbym, żeby zadała mi to samo pytanie w ciągu dnia, i najlepiej w nieco innym stanie umysłu. Pewien Chińczyk powiedział mi, że starał się o względy tegoż dziewczęcia od wielu lat, i żebym tego nie spierniczył.

      Wymieniliśmy się numerami telefonów, ale niedługo potem jej smartfon rozpuścił się w tęczowe światło i powrócił do przestrzeni. Nana biegała po klubie, w nadziei, że może zaginięcie nie jest jeszcze ostateczne i nieodwracalne. Niestety, telefon nie odnalazł się. Dziewczęciu bardzo zależało na pozostaniu ze mną w kontakcie, dlatego też dała mi numer do swojego przyjaciela, po czym obróciła się na pięcie i odjechała do domu zieloną chengduską taksówką zaprzężoną w dwa siwe koniki.

      Nazajutrz Kopciuszek nie odezwała się. Nie zgubiła nawet pantofelka. Z drugiej strony, byłoby chyba nieludzkie oczekiwać, żeby dziewczyna gubiła obuwie po tym, jak straciła telefon. Caystal pisała mi, że ukradziono jej w „1855” już: komórkę, portfel, torebkę, pieniądze i odzież &mdash; a mimo to nadal przychodzi tam dzień w dzień. Upija się Rémy Martinem i tańczy do utraty tchu. To właśnie jest szczęście.

      Szukam czegoś, co nada memu życiu sens. Czyżby czas na kolejną koreańską dramę?

      Dzień 29 (222) w Chinach</strong><br />
      Kupiłem bilet do Seoulu i z powrotem. Wylot z Chongqingu 16 kwietnia, powrót 26 kwietnia. W obie strony przesiadka w Xiamen. Właściwie to nie bardzo mam na tę wycieczkę pieniądze. Cała moja nadzieja w tym, aby International Students' Office, tak jak obiecało, przysłało nam na kwiecień podwojone stypendium z rekompensatą za wcześniejsze miesiące, spędzone w ubóstwie i smutku.

      Day 93 (286) in China</strong><br />
      === The Long-Gone Utopia ===
      I recall there was a time in my life when I was highly enthusiastic about China and the Chinese language. When I started learning Mandarin almost five years ago, I was absolutely fascinated about Chinese characters, and I spent most of the boring, inert time in school practising my Chinese handwriting, and studying vocabulary and grammar. I once wrote on my blog (albeit the original story has long gone been blasted into oblivion,) about the stories I read in my textbooks, an obsolete vision of Chinese everyday life, the long-gone utopia only preserved now in the form of reading materials. My first textbook, ''A Course in Contemporary Chinese'' (现代汉语教程,) told at length of the little joys, as well as hardships, that foreign students in China supposedly experienced. All the imaginary creatures described in those stories bore Generic Foreign Names&mdash;Ali (阿里,) Mary (玛丽,) Jones (琼斯,) and of course the late lamented teacher Ma (马老师, you will be missed!) Why did the editors' leave unsaid the ubiquity of Korean students? Well, I know that foreigners of different nationalities are spread all around the country, like peanut butter on a horribly malformed toast. There are many Kazakhis and Pakistanis in Xi'An, many Indians in Chengdu (studying Medicine,) and there is even a group of Polish students in Kunming, notoriously mistaken for Russians or Uyghurs, and decimated by the absolutely repugnant cuisine of the region. There is also a huge diaspora of barely legal economic immigrants from the U.S. and A., who came to Asia to participate in that abominable form of organized crime called Teaching English as a Foreign Language. But the Koreans? Seriously, they are ''everywhere''! I wish I owned a refrigerator, so I could tell my friends that I'm afraid of opening my fridge not to meet a Korean!

      I remember a story of a school trip, told in my textbook. I don't give a damn about the supposed destination of that school trip, as I'm pretty damn sure that particular adventure of the foreign students was merely a figment of the creators' obscene imagination. As everyone knows, all touristic spots in Mainland China are exactly the same, the only difference is that some of them are overpriced, and the others are outrageously overpriced. The Chinese like to boast about their ancient civilization and splendid culture, about how they invented compass, gun powder, banknotes, wheel, fire and government corruption, well, so what if they did? All that cultural heritage and natural beauty that survived 66 years of communism, the Great Cultural Revolution and overexploitation of natural resources, is now turned into merchandise. Entrance tickets for most scenic spots are incredibly expensive, and people living in the vicinity of these attractions use every opportunity to drain the tourists' money. The worst case of this phenomenon was probably the Huangguoshu Waterfall in Guizhou province, where the entrance tickets cost 160 rmb, and that didn't even include transportation to the scenic area. To get to the waterfall, you could either take the overcrowded public bus (only running during high season,) the sightseeing bus (50 rmb/person!) or a cab for up to 60 rmb/person! Considering the fact that a normal salary in Guizhou province is about 2000 rmb a month, if you go sightseeing, you'd better be either a millionaire or out of your mind.

      I just found the original blog post from 2010: [[Blog:Elefanto/100. W imię ponadczasowych idei|100. W imię ponadczasowych idei]].
      <blockquote>
      Jakby tak dało radę, resztę mojego życia mógłbym spędzić w świecie podręczników do chińskiego. Po 45 lekcjach odnoszę wrażenie, że musi tam być naprawdę wspaniale. Wszyscy albo studiują na 北京语言学院 (pin. ''Běijīng Yǔyán Xuéyuàn'', Pekiński Instytut Językowy), albo są tam nauczycielami, albo Bohaterami Niezależnymi (tzw. Non-Player Character). Wszyscy 中国学生和留学生 (pin. ''Zhōngguó xuésheng hé liúxuéshēng'', studenci chińscy i z zagranicy) mieszkają w akademiku, jeżdżą na wycieczki na Mur Chiński, i zamiast w autokarze chomikować alkohol, oni chcą siedzieć koło profesora Bai albo profesora Ma. Na stołówce jedzą chińskie żarcie po psich cenach; a ich imprezy!
      </blockquote>
      A Rough Translation:
      <blockquote>
      If I had the right opportunity, I could spend the rest of my life in the world of Chinese textbooks. After 45 lessons I get the feeling that it must be a really wonderful place. Everyone either studies at 北京语言学院 (pin. ''Běijīng Yǔyán Xuéyuàn'', Beijing Language and Culture University,) or teaches there, or is an independent character, a so-called ''Non-Player Character''. All the students, both from China and from Overseas, live in the dormitory, go on trips to the Great Wall, and instead of smuggling alcohol in the coach, they prefer to seat next to Professor Bai or Professor Ma. In the school canteen, they can eat Chinese food, cheap as chips; but best of all are their parties!
      </blockquote>
      In the times when my textbook was compiled, apparently the entrance tickets weren't so expensive. I wonder where these times went. I didn't go to any of the school trips Sichuan University offered to foreign students for free. I sometimes regret not participating in the free trip to Jiuzhaigou, where water is like the heavenliest shade of azure I would ever dare imagine, with a bunch of hot Koreans, in October, but I guess I had my reasons. I'm going back to Poland in around three weeks, and I don't think I'll go anywhere else. And there are many places I still want to go.

      <!-- joie de vivre -->
      This world is pretty much doomed. I read in one of the e-mails from Avaaz that 2014 was the hottest year in history. If it's not a heat wave that kills us, it will be something else, be it an alien invasion or the rising ocean. I would like to express my congratulations to humanity for being the stupidest and most dangerous species that ever appeared on the surface of this planet. I'm not afraid of death, and if humanity becomes extinct at some point, it will only be for the greater good of the Planet Earth. Thank you.
