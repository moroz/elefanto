  content: "Today's post is in English, as cases of people not speaking English at all
    are as rare as interesting moments at school. The point is that on Monday, 3rd Jan.,
    that is the first Monday of the year, I was late for English. My teacher came to
    me, while I was discussing New Year's celebrations with my schoolmate, Marta, and
    ordered me to write an essay of 250 words. The result goes below.\r\n<em>\r\n<h6>My
    New Year's Resolution - be on time in English lesson and how to achieve it</h6>\r\nA
    common European custom is making New Year's resolutions. Most of these are plans
    of losing a few pounds or quitting smoking. My English teacher suggested that my
    only resolution could be not being late for English lessons every time, as I don't
    smoke, nor am I overweight. I'm not sure if I agree with that as there are many
    subjects of making resolutions way more interesting than those English lessons at
    five to nine early in the morning - I don't even know if there is a single being
    in our galaxy willing to attend such lessons, but OK - I might try.\r\n\r\nIn order
    to achieve the goal of not being late, one needs:\r\n<ul><li>a working alarm clock
    loud enough to wake them up (a few hours before sunrise),</li><li>three cubic meters
    of hot, „pickaxe-strong” coffee to bring them back to the awful reality, full of
    routine, wars and insecurities,</li><li>and an ability to leave home 30 minutes
    before the lesson starts, which is almost impossible if one has such urgent needs
    as drinking the last cup of delicious jasmine tea or packing the survival kit (mostly
    books.)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nThe real problem with me is not that I can't get up early
    enough, but that everythings seems so important. Then I realize it's 8.40 and I
    still need to moisten my throat with some tap water, than it's just too late and
    I can't help it anymore. Dear teacher! It looks like I'll never be able to come
    on time again.\r\n</em>\r\n<h6>Asskicking party</h6>\r\nSo, I just came home from
    18th birthday party of my colleague from the music school, Marlena. The party was
    completely awesome, including large-breasted girls (or maybe just one), free alcohol
    and wild dances with all the women present. Fellow brass players advised me to practise
    more, so as to become a good player. Finally, it looks like my ability to write
    any meaningful text in foreign languages at 2 am can be affected by drinking beer
    accompanied by French fries, Greek fish, Polish hamburgers and some weird wines.\r\n\r\nI
    still think a lot about my weight-height ratio. I tried to run a few laps around
    the place undisturbed by the sounds of traffic, but I eventually run into some friend
    and everything got screwed up. I still think a lot about everything I could do better
    in the past or that I could do better in the future, but obviously I won't. I wonder
    if printing a few more sheets of lousy elephant business cards could help me prevent
    further development of melancholy. The only thing I know for sure is that my English
    sucks and I'm not going to use it in the blog for quite a moment. Maybe my next
    project could be an internationalized blog just in English? I'm not sure if it makes
    any sense, knowing that almost no one read any of the texts in Esperanto. Hopefully
    there are more people able to understand my terrible English than just the one,
    which in fact may be the same lonely person that had ever read any of the texts
    in Esperanto. The website could be named „Poor but Awesome”, or rather something
    way more corresponding to the real reality, like „Memories of an Elephant” or „Memories
    of the only person in galaxy who has elephant in their business cards”. Also the
    content management system I would code from scratch using Ruby on Rails and NetBeans,
    which I think are almost as awesome as the 1m girls. Together they could act as
    a software version of Mountainpunch and Oakextracter, famous characters from Slavic
    mythology; still, I'm not sure, which one could act as which of those.\r\n\r\n"

  content: "Nothing's different, either. At least the weather's nice. It was 8 &deg;C
    in the morning, while I was lazily walking back to school after a weekend. The Elephant
    is back! Some minutes past nine and I am in front of the classroom door, corridors
    empty, no one is home. Enter the Elephant! A few loud steps and sound of funfairs.
    I was wondering how to greet my fellow classmates in an unusual way. My face was
    showing a horrible grin of both joy and space, due to getting quite a lot of sleep,
    green tea and drugs, some mandalas offered at the weekend, and a few more joyful
    circumstances. Meanwhile, royal elephant helpers blocked my way, and I heard:\r\n'The
    Tiiimeee&hellip; is OVER,' said mistress Teacher. 'Goodbye.'\r\n\r\nIt took me a
    moment to regain consciousness outside the classroom. A quick look at the phone's
    display told me that there was still a lot of time and space for joyous activities,
    such as walking outdoors. Thus I was punished for being late by being allowed to
    go out. That sounds nice and logical. I wonder why there still are people who think
    I would regret my acts of laziness if they gave me a huge banknote and told me to
    go get myself some drugs and rethink my life somewhere else. How the heck can I
    regret being late, if we get a few moments of October in the middle of January?
    Sometimes fighting the system is just nice.\r\n\r\nWhat's neither the same anymore,
    nor any different, is that the girls never even bother to look in my direction,
    at least not the nice ones. If I memorized all the spells from the spellbook that
    I've inherited from uncle Merlin, or induced some of the miracles that could lead
    Guru Rinpoche to pure envy, I'm sure they wouldn't even notice.\r\nI wonder why
    there are some people that are weird and are of an elephant's shape to a degree
    even greater than mine, which are certainly not handsome or tall, but still have
    effect on chicks like fly paper on flies.\r\n\r\n"
