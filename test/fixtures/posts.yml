content: "Today's post is in English, as cases of people not speaking English at all
  are as rare as interesting moments at school. The point is that on Monday, 3rd Jan.,
  that is the first Monday of the year, I was late for English. My teacher came to
  me, while I was discussing New Year's celebrations with my schoolmate, Marta, and
  ordered me to write an essay of 250 words. The result goes below.\r\n<em>\r\n<h6>My
  New Year's Resolution - be on time in English lesson and how to achieve it</h6>\r\nA
  common European custom is making New Year's resolutions. Most of these are plans
  of losing a few pounds or quitting smoking. My English teacher suggested that my
  only resolution could be not being late for English lessons every time, as I don't
  smoke, nor am I overweight. I'm not sure if I agree with that as there are many
  subjects of making resolutions way more interesting than those English lessons at
  five to nine early in the morning - I don't even know if there is a single being
  in our galaxy willing to attend such lessons, but OK - I might try.\r\n\r\nIn order
  to achieve the goal of not being late, one needs:\r\n<ul><li>a working alarm clock
  loud enough to wake them up (a few hours before sunrise),</li><li>three cubic meters
  of hot, „pickaxe-strong” coffee to bring them back to the awful reality, full of
  routine, wars and insecurities,</li><li>and an ability to leave home 30 minutes
  before the lesson starts, which is almost impossible if one has such urgent needs
  as drinking the last cup of delicious jasmine tea or packing the survival kit (mostly
  books.)</li></ul>\r\n\r\nThe real problem with me is not that I can't get up early
  enough, but that everythings seems so important. Then I realize it's 8.40 and I
  still need to moisten my throat with some tap water, than it's just too late and
  I can't help it anymore. Dear teacher! It looks like I'll never be able to come
  on time again.\r\n</em>\r\n<h6>Asskicking party</h6>\r\nSo, I just came home from
  18th birthday party of my colleague from the music school, Marlena. The party was
  completely awesome, including large-breasted girls (or maybe just one), free alcohol
  and wild dances with all the women present. Fellow brass players advised me to practise
  more, so as to become a good player. Finally, it looks like my ability to write
  any meaningful text in foreign languages at 2 am can be affected by drinking beer
  accompanied by French fries, Greek fish, Polish hamburgers and some weird wines.\r\n\r\nI
  still think a lot about my weight-height ratio. I tried to run a few laps around
  the place undisturbed by the sounds of traffic, but I eventually run into some friend
  and everything got screwed up. I still think a lot about everything I could do better
  in the past or that I could do better in the future, but obviously I won't. I wonder
  if printing a few more sheets of lousy elephant business cards could help me prevent
  further development of melancholy. The only thing I know for sure is that my English
  sucks and I'm not going to use it in the blog for quite a moment. Maybe my next
  project could be an internationalized blog just in English? I'm not sure if it makes
  any sense, knowing that almost no one read any of the texts in Esperanto. Hopefully
  there are more people able to understand my terrible English than just the one,
  which in fact may be the same lonely person that had ever read any of the texts
  in Esperanto. The website could be named „Poor but Awesome”, or rather something
  way more corresponding to the real reality, like „Memories of an Elephant” or „Memories
  of the only person in galaxy who has elephant in their business cards”. Also the
  content management system I would code from scratch using Ruby on Rails and NetBeans,
  which I think are almost as awesome as the 1m girls. Together they could act as
  a software version of Mountainpunch and Oakextracter, famous characters from Slavic
  mythology; still, I'm not sure, which one could act as which of those.\r\n\r\n"

content: "Nothing's different, either. At least the weather's nice. It was 8 &deg;C
  in the morning, while I was lazily walking back to school after a weekend. The Elephant
  is back! Some minutes past nine and I am in front of the classroom door, corridors
  empty, no one is home. Enter the Elephant! A few loud steps and sound of funfairs.
  I was wondering how to greet my fellow classmates in an unusual way. My face was
  showing a horrible grin of both joy and space, due to getting quite a lot of sleep,
  green tea and drugs, some mandalas offered at the weekend, and a few more joyful
  circumstances. Meanwhile, royal elephant helpers blocked my way, and I heard:\r\n'The
  Tiiimeee&hellip; is OVER,' said mistress Teacher. 'Goodbye.'\r\n\r\nIt took me a
  moment to regain consciousness outside the classroom. A quick look at the phone's
  display told me that there was still a lot of time and space for joyous activities,
  such as walking outdoors. Thus I was punished for being late by being allowed to
  go out. That sounds nice and logical. I wonder why there still are people who think
  I would regret my acts of laziness if they gave me a huge banknote and told me to
  go get myself some drugs and rethink my life somewhere else. How the heck can I
  regret being late, if we get a few moments of October in the middle of January?
  Sometimes fighting the system is just nice.\r\n\r\nWhat's neither the same anymore,
  nor any different, is that the girls never even bother to look in my direction,
  at least not the nice ones. If I memorized all the spells from the spellbook that
  I've inherited from uncle Merlin, or induced some of the miracles that could lead
  Guru Rinpoche to pure envy, I'm sure they wouldn't even notice.\r\nI wonder why
  there are some people that are weird and are of an elephant's shape to a degree
  even greater than mine, which are certainly not handsome or tall, but still have
  effect on chicks like fly paper on flies.\r\n\r\n"

content: "Today, or, since a few minutes ago - yesterday, was Friday. I don't know
  what the others may think about that, but for me Friday used to be one of the words
  to express freedom. Democracy or equal rights might be great and brave, but, especially
  when looking at their implementation in the USA, seem to fade out besides such a
  brilliant time as Friday, when there's nothing that you really have to do, and you
  can just meet your friends and talk about your plans for the future, either as distant
  as the 60s or as close as following evening. While Monday is the day of complaining
  about getting up at a time one had rather go to sleep if not the duties of the youth,
  then remembering the parties one has been to, I get more and more surprised by the
  power of dreams and wishes we often discuss on Fridays. If that's not freedom, then
  what it is?\r\n\r\nI went to a party at Radek's, with a quick stop at a shop in
  the city centre. I thought I would manage to buy myself a beer with my ID card,
  if at least the year of birth fits the stereotype of an eighteen-years-old, but
  no! The shop assistant didn't even ask. Just a moment later I bumped into a friend
  from the kindergarten, who obviously was the first person that had ever read the
  first post on good old Ubogo, Ale Chędogo, back in 2008.\r\n\r\nThen there was a
  party. Well, not strictly a party, but rather an evening by a shared table. We have
  drunk and talked about the past. One of us told a story of his past girlfriend that
  lived in some awesomely distant place, where he couldn't even sleep because of birds
  singing all day long from 5 in the morning, which seems really terrible. Her house
  used to be a manor, then turned into a school, which was then sold to one of the
  teachers, or something similar. Her room was once a classroom, so it must have been
  really big. I especially liked the part when he went back home to Koszalin on foot,
  32 kilometers in one piece, so as not to be impolite staying overnight at hers.
  I like long walks just as much as I like riding my bike all day long or cooking.
  The more I think of them, the more I associate it with freedom of travelling, a
  tent by the road, hitch-hiking and traversing foreign galaxies in order to rescue
  one's beloved from slimy arms of some dirty pervert with three heads and one green
  eye. Then come mental images of fresh tomatoes, peppers, watermelons and cherries,
  and all these things that are only available in the summer.\r\n\r\nI guess that
  there is a bunch of nice girls I could share my meals with, especially one in the
  mat-inf-fiz. Unfortunately, none of them seems to care about my will of being generous
  on the level of food, in fact, I don't even know any of them in person. I don't
  know if there is a feeling more pathetic than the one when a girl of my daydreams
  passes by several times a day, but some mental database lock denies me access to
  my speech centre. Of course, I could still shout some undefined sounds (if the sound
  of 0 is silence, then what is the sound of '''nil'''?) or one of lovely Chinese
  onomatopeias (哎呀！ 喂！ 嘿！ 嗯！), but I guess they would sound weird in the ears of a
  person with not much interest in East Asian languages, and eventually lead to a
  look of disgust and render the shouter incompatible with the girl's vision of a
  potential eating partner. And even if there were a girl crazy about such multilingual
  elephants eating oatmeal, and even if I met her in person, something would certainly
  go wrong. She could do spelling mistakes, for example omit a comma or interrobang
  (‽), which bespeaks a high level of linguistic ignorance and an apparent hatred
  for one's mother tongue.\r\nOh, yeah, one has a lot of problems, if he can't even
  announce his presence to a girl constantly passing by in the same manner since October.\r\n"

content: "'''Excercise. Write a story, in which a sudden occurence during a plane
  flight causes your delay and you have problems because of that.'''\r\n\r\nThe attempt
  to write the excercise is caused by my profound will to fight the system, or, to
  be honest and more precise, to fight the school - the way you befriend a foe to
  stab them in their back with a convenient pocket dagger (which I always carry by
  my side), after you have drunk vodka together for their money, while the foe is
  sleeping. This is the same movement that caused me to read ''Potop'' when we had
  to read ''Tartuffe'', and that makes me read ''Forefather's Eve'', which we have
  already finished a few months ago. Therefore is the story toxic to the senses and
  lethal to the soul. Keep that in mind and beware!\r\n\r\n<h3>Crossing the border</h3>\r\nA
  few years ago me and my brother Steve were flying home from Sydney. The journey
  was quite pleasant and interesting. I was sitting by the window and admiring clouds,
  sliding down there, a few thousand feet above the ground. I tried to listen to music,
  but it sounded weird, then I tried to read, but the letters were jumping in my eyes,
  so I couldn't catch their sense.\r\nThen I realized those were the symptoms I had
  heard so much of before: we were crossing the Transcendental Border of Multi-Dimensionsional
  Eternity. Steve and I looked at each other meaningfully and I saw a quiet, non-verbal
  oh-yeah in his eyes. And then it happened.\r\n\r\nA mild, pleasant thrill at first,
  then I felt as if hit with nothingness - it can't hurt, but hurts yet more. Immediately,
  my consciousness emerged from three-dimensional sensory percepcion of space to six-dimensional,
  then to the seventh, ultimate level, where nothing more can occur.\r\nDo you know
  what a parallel universe is? Some theories say that each time there is a possibility
  of any choice, even the smallest, there appears a separate universe for both options.
  Let's try to count them. If our universe emerged after what we call a Big Bang and
  will probably end in a similar way by what scientists call a Big Collapse, a rough
  estimation of how long a universe can last is at least a few billion years, which
  is already quite impressive, isn't it? But can we be sure our universe is the only
  one? What if Big Bangs and Big Collapses are cyclic, like an infinite loop, which
  no one can break even with a Ctrl-C keyboard shortcut? Then it would be few billion
  years multiplied by infinity, which is even more impressive. Obviously, a simple
  &#8734; looks quite euphemistic for a symbol of all of that. And now imagine that
  every smallest moment some choice is possible in every point of space - and each
  of them creates at least two parallel universes.\r\nAnd I have experienced them
  all - at once. I could see everything that could happen in every point of space,
  any time in any of all of &#8734; parallel universes. I could see moments of both
  my own birth and death, also multiplied ''almost'' &#8734; times, ''almost'' - because
  in some universes I had never existed, and I could see whether they were doing better
  without me. I have seen all of the Big Bangs and Big Collapses. Everything seems
  different after such an experience - how can one define everything, anyway? And
  when did such an experience occur? Who can experience it?\r\n\r\nIn what we call
  the real world - either because of ignorance, a shared pact of silence, a custom,
  or just because it seems way simpler that way - the whole thing had only lasted
  a time needed for an eyeblink. But in that very moment my mind had changed in all
  three times at once. I know my knowledge and intelligence had developed significantly
  ever since, but the sacrifice I have done is even more terrible. I have lost my
  peace of mind forever and will never be able to regain it.\r\n"

  got quite cold in the past few days, forcing me to wear my jacket and move as fast
  as possible without exposing my neck to the wind, but my curiosity prevailed my
  sense of warmth after I saw four gentlemen carrying what looked like a wooden log,
  but was apparently a human corpse, across the crossroads. I came closer when they
  stopped for a while, and then I realized I knew one of those gentlemen. I called
  his name twice, until he turned his head towards me. His face was showing a mild
  grin of hope.\r\n'Jason!' he called me by my nickname, dating back from the good
  old times at school. 'You're the only man that can help us carry him, at least before
  the police sees us.'\r\n'That's no problem,' I replied. 'I should have already been
  home for ten hours now. My poor old mother certainly won't like it. But who cares?
  One who writes for the famous Elefanto, should always be prepared for long-distance
  corpse carrying.'\r\nSo I took one leg in my hands. Then I glanced at the corpse.
  He was quite young, maybe 16 or 17 years old. He must have been alive just a few
  moments earlier. He had no warm clothes on him, his joints were already getting
  stiff, and his skin was cooling very quickly. I wondered, what happened to him at
  such a young age, as I couldn't see any wounds, or even blood, but a quick look
  at the gloomy faces of my comrades assured me in not asking any questions.\r\nIt
  took us eight hours to take the man back to his homeland in Białogard. My legs started
  to hurt after the first hour, my head was bouncing from side to side of exhaustion,
  but at 6 in the morning we put the man on a couch and covered him with a piece of
  magical Something. My new friends have told me, that the man was their friend, who
  had drunk quite a lot this evening, and that he had managed to drink half a liter
  of vodka, together with just four people. He wasn't dead yet, but it was close.\r\nAfter
  they had finished the story, we drunk a hearty Bruderschaft together (man, is there
  such a word in English?), then I said goodbye and walked back home.\r\n\r\nI wonder
  what makes people destroy their lives in such a horrible way. I think that, if I
  ever manage to have grandchildren (or even just children, which is quite unlikely
  - the most beautiful girl in the galaxy, the one from mat-inf-fiz, doesn't give
  a fuck about my existence; I could walk to Częstochowa on my knees for that one
  if weren't a Buddhist), I could sit back in my comfy armchair, with my favorite
  pipe, filled with Amphora tobacco, and tell them:\r\n'Guys, when I was 17, I used
  to carry corpses of young gentlemen of your age, together with my friends. And there
  were always a few beers in that good ol' checked jacket of mine.'\r\n"

  made an exception this time, and convinced my mother to book a 9-day ski camp in
  Innsbruck. I wouldn't go anywhere with those hungry consumerist bastards of human
  interest for the rest of world, their unwillingness to organize their journeys themselves
  and the horrible pandemic of not reading the agreements one signs at all, but, unfortunately,
  it isn't usually ''that'' easy for a brok 17-year-old to just go skiing abroad,
  you know. I could promise never to go anywhere, except for skiing, with any of those
  wandering braineaters (so as not to say: vultures, as they're considered the most
  noble of all birds - they never kill for food, you know), but I know enough to know
  that one never knows. I could get infested by Yeerks, you know, and establish a
  travel agency myself, or even just get hired in one of those one day. If so, I would
  just need to make sure I'm not going anywhere with Polish tourists. They're just
  terrible, drinking vodka all the time, speaking in an annoying, arrogant manner
  and they're most often Catholics, as most consumeristic douchebags have grown up
  in Christian families. Russians would do.\r\n\r\nDuring my preparations for the
  journey, I need to make sure there is always some backdoor way of misbehaving, disobedience
  and avoiding taking part in any activities provided by the organizers. During a
  karaoke evening I could play the piano (if there is one) or offer mandalas, or even
  just write the blog on a laptop. I wonder if we're allowed to drink alcohol there.
  I can legally drink in Austria, you know, the drinking age is 16 there. I could
  just sit at the bar and have a beer or five every evening, but if we're not allowed,
  I'd have to buy ten beers in some shop every day and drink them in my room - we're
  going to live in some lousy 4-star hotel, you know. I have no doubt there will be
  a sauna and a swimming pool, I just wonder about the piano. How can I escape from
  the hotel to a Diamondway Buddhist Centre?\r\n\r\nMy usual association with travel
  agencies leads to a certain group of people - although I know it is not really wise
  to put people in such chests of drawers. Those are the ladies that lie on the beach
  all day anywhere they go, to achieve a nice, reddish suntan (whose color resembles
  that of diarrhoeal feces of a heroin addict), and the gentlemen that work out all
  day to drive their attention straight from the beach to their hotel rooms. Their
  picture galleries on Facebook usually resemble lists of geographical points we have
  to memorize for the needs of our extended-level geography at school. Thus I can
  meditate and spend my time in peace of mind in ''really'' nice spots, with no unwanted
  companion at all. Which one do ''you'' prefer: Porost or Ibiza?\r\n"

  ask me for ID while buying alcohol. The place itself is decorated in a fairly pleasant

  of dumb girls I would have rather expected to see in Fregata or Zacisze. Some Asian-looking
  chick asks me whether I mind having an Asian girlfriend. \"Of course I do!,\" I
  say. \"I am not suitable for any girl as I'm mean and disgusting.\" Then I start
  telling jokes about dead foetuses. 5 zlotys was way too much.\r\nA visit in the
  library. I read a book about Chinese calligraphy, one of those nice books for people
  with aptitude for drawing that cost the half of a Van Gogh painting, but you can
  read them during one break at school, because most of their volume is nice paper.
  Furthermore, they're glued and won't lie flat, and therefore can't be kept open
  while you're trying to practise calligraphy excercises from the book. I don't care
  about the calligraphy, so I just wrote down a few idioms. 杯弓蛇影 (to confuse a reflection
  of a bow in a glass with a snake), 画龙点睛 (to paint the dragon and dots in its eyes).
  These are nice.\r\n\r\nFriday. I remember having drunk beer on the roof of an 11-floor
  building. However, my mobile phone's sent text messages might prove the truth of
  the fashionable modern proverb ''\"Pijesz &mdash; nie pisz\"'' (don't text when
  you drink). I don't mind having written stupid messages if they caused at least
  mild critics; but no, they were left without answer!\r\nMorning. I manage to be
  5 minutes late in English even though I were already at school 10 minutes before.
  I tell my teacher it's the psychological war.\r\nLong-distance time planning excercise.
  My geography teacher claims that with my current set of grades in her subject I
  will have to see her in August. I guess it's nice, because if I stay in the second
  grade, I could change my class to 1M, because there are nice chicks. Everyone around
  says that my plan is pure madness. Hopefully I will eventually have the choice.\r\n\r\nThursday.
  A test in English. The excercise says to ''make questions and answer''.\r\nQuestion
  5. ''What's the riskiest thing you have ever done''?\r\nMy answer. ''The first riskiest
  was being born at all, the second was not becoming gay, which makes me prone to
  falling in love with 1M girls.''\r\nThe teacher starts to laugh after having read
  it.\r\n\r\n"

  for almost three years &mdash; which means that I was only 14.5 y.o. on the day
  when I first opened my magical text editor (''gedit Merlin edition'') window in
  an IT lesson at school. Now that I'm so old and arrogant, I don't even look in the
  direction where a person below the magical border of 16 could ever pass, remembering
  all those joyous days of my early youth seems at least a bit inadequate; despite,
  I'll never forget how my world had changed, after I've claimed my own bit of space
  on the Internet.\r\n\r\nThere is magic in the people and in their words. And I'm
  sure, that there has always been some purely Pagan magic in space all around. I'm
  not sure about it's real nature, though. Could it possibly be a sort of transcendental
  vibration in sounds of raindrops falling outside on my windowsill? Etherical bits
  of stardust flying around in the wind? The first sip of a love potion (called ''beer''
  in Muggle slang), drunk on the roof of a certain building with a good friend, with
  essential darkness, emanating from everywhere around? (In case you don't know, a
  ''real'' city, as mine, is never asleep. It is a living organism, whose inhaling
  and exhaling we experience as darkness and light, or 阴 and 阳, that is, yin and yang.)
  Due to my basic ignorance for magical affairs, though, I can never feel that magic
  well enough.\r\nAnd there is certainly a lot of magic in the smile of a girl, possibly
  even more than in Harry Potter's magical wand, (11\" holly, phoenix feather core).\r\n\r\nI'm
  not sure if I won't sound too posh writing so, but I've already seen a mortal girl
  one day (most probably a Muggle or squib), looking at me with some buttery vision
  simply because some Nebraska faggot has written something and then published it
  to some lousy website (full of bare feet and elephants). This may seem weird, compared
  to the degree of softness of my knees in the presence of certain Objects of Interest,
  most commonly located in <span style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">1m</span>, the
  Math.-IT-Phys. class.\r\n\r\nAnd there are many simple moments enchated into certain
  posts; when I read about my psychedelic trip to Mielno in those early days, I can
  almost feel the sand running around my bare feet, as if there were a parallel universe
  preserved in my mind in its essential form, untouched by time and everyday sorrows.\r\n"

  just need another holiday. That's the same, that a character in the book I've read
  recently (that is, ''Lalka'' by Bolesław Prus) had said and even written in his
  diary (which is a protoplast of bloggies, in case you don't know), just a few weeks
  before having died on heart failure in his chaise longue. Still, I can't deny that
  I haven't had a decent whole night's sleep for zillions of ages. At least I've been
  to a nice party with my cousin, the author of my favourite <a href=\"http://ant8.blogspot.com\">ant8.blogspot.com</a>
  bloggie, and a few dozens of Buddhists; there I have taken tons of sweet pictures
  with a chick 14 years older than me, and so on.\r\nI began to read ''Crime and Punishment''.\r\n\r\nI
  remember now that I've always hoped to eventually become a writer. That's not just
  because some of them earn a lot of money for writing just what all those consumeristic
  consumers want, but I have just always felt a writer, just the same way that I like
  the student lifestyle in general. And I will have to change my lifestyle somehow;
  I guess I've become way too static recently. Still, I'll have to do something about
  my grades, and get some sleep first. And I got bored with wild partying for a moment.\r\nThe
  full moon is shining outside my train's window and that reminds me of the only <span
  style=\"font-variant: small-caps;\">1m</span> girl that talks to me at all (and
  has nice boobs), just because she had once said that she liked vampire books. I
  wonder where the world would end up without big-breasted girls.\r\n\r\n"

  No movement.
  The last sentence refers to the weblog of my father's cousin (shall I call him: uncle?), who keeps posting exciting information about his placement on Earth, like "it's still Cracow", "it's Ulan Bator", "Coruscant" or "at a small planet of Naboo". Well, how boring my life could seem, compared to his! I still have four days left to waste because of pangalactic exams going on currently. Unfortunately, no one seems to fancy spending that time with '''me''', though.

  That is, when I write a message to some folks, all they say is usually "Man, I can't, see ya tomorrow!" or "I am currently very busy/Not present in Koszalin/Extraterrestial forms of intelligence have just invited everyone in the universe but you to a pangalactic party with hookers a huge variety of free soft drinks and hard drugs, hahahah LOL you loser" and so on. Meanwhile, most attractive chicks with nothing meaningful to do still prefer to spend their time on their own, at least without me, while attractive chicks, currently needing nothing but my bodily love, are at school or have been evaporated lately, as a result of recent accidents with nuclear evaporators, maaan, what sort of chicks they all were! How lonely I began to feel now that they're gone... Now that everyone is gone... and I have no more money left to waste.

  But it has always been so! There are times when I get involved in wild parties with loads of crazy chicks, but, according to timeless rules, after a period of wild parties comes a wild hangover and everyone just goes home! I get a few phone numbers and text the chicks once or twice, then they become bored; they stop answering my messages and convince their boyfriends to hire an assassin, so that I end up with three problems: boredom, the chick and the assassin... Still, it has nothing to do with the fact that sometimes school is more bearable than it seems; well, maybe not in the high school.

  Then there rang a doorbell. How could that happen at that time? I jumped the way from my piano practising room to the hall (not to confuse with my dancehall, which only exists in the seventh dimension). I opened the door, but as soon as I saw two elderly people with thin coloured magazines in their bags, I already knew who they were and I closed my door, preventing them from stealing my soul through discussion (it's worth way too much hard drugs to let them have it), but they were quicker. The elderly man put his shoe of pure technetium between my door and its frame, so as not to let me escape.
  "Please!" shouted the man. "Take at least a free issue of this interesting magazine."
  "No, thanks," I said.
  "Just a magazine! See, there are interesting articles in this one," said the man enthusiasticly. "For example, have you ever thought about the perfection, with which our human body is designed? Isn't it a proof that it was designed by our perfect Creator?"
  "Well, then mine must have been defective, because what I see is a fragile pile of blood and bones, easily destructible. Breaking your spine might end up with lifelong paralysis..."
  "Look at your eyes! Have you known that no camera has ever been built more precisely and perfectly? Doesn't that prove that it was designed by a god?"
  "Well, I guess it doesn't. It only proves that it was built more precisely and perfectly that any human-built camera. Yet the body in general seems absolutely random."
  "But no man has ever designed a human yet!"
  "If I had over four milliard years of spare time and were as bored as your god, I would create a human too! And it would be way more perfect than this time. Goodbye."

  And I'm left with an issue of this month's ''Awake!''. I have to do it (that is, awake) in a few hours, so farewell, my dear readers! It was 5th May, 2011.

  A brief look at most of my family's blogs seems enough to make me at least a bit embarassed. Not only is my own lousy website not really active, but also for some reason I decided to prolong that '''foreign-sounding comedy''', which really feels a bit weird. Nevertheless, I could at least leave a few words about stuff going on around recently.
  Firstly, a '''weather phenomenon''' &mdash; my father's cousin writes about a thunderstorm in Cracow, and, on the following day, a thunderstorm catches me on my way home from the 5th official <a href="http://www.pecha-kucha.org/">PechaKucha</a> Night in Koszalin. It may seem simple, but it made me feel as if the weather conditions came from the internet. Nevermind.
  Another phenomenon is connected with cities and '''cultural events'''. I have noticed that in Koszalin, there are those periods where nothing interesting is happening and even nothing boring, but when someone actually organizes an event, you can't even make a step, because there is an event on every tile in the pavement, really! There are usually so many of them that nobody can't count them, not to mention visiting a zillionth part. Couldn't they distribute them a bit more evenly? So that I don't get bored on lazy Sundays, but the choice of wild parties on Fridays isn't wider than my vision.

  There is a risk that I might be going to China this year (if I manage to raise my fat buttocks and go get myself a passport before the moment when our Sun turns into a Red Dwarf and '''everything that I have ever loved''' on this planet gets irreversibly demolished). People deserving a postcard could send their addresses to me, but I am quite sure I will forget everything anyway. I went to Milan a few months ago and it wasn't '''that''' interesting &mdash; it seems that most of Italy consists of old buildings and scooters. How boring. Many Italians can't speak English at all and the only way of communicating with them remaining is body language, which only makes sense at a certain level of relationships. How nice it is to learn Chinese and be able to order '''noodles''' in Chinese! Have I said that I loved noodles yet?

  When I ever go running at all (which usually happens once an eon or only slightly more frequently), I always try to choose a path which nobody walks. I have already experienced so many weird, annoying encounters while running that never let me go on running; therefore today, when I was suffering from an excessive amount of energy, circulating in my subtle bodies, I decided to have a short run on the path to Jamno. Who could walk there?
  ...and then I saw a lonely teenage girl, walking her dog, and realized that I knew her.
  'Walking your dog again, huh?' I said.
  'Yeah,' said Weronika from the second hum-jour class, for whom I have already written a short poem, which she liked. The history of that <a href="/posts/Postcard for Weronika">poem</a> is on its most profound level connected with our last skiing expedition, which I don't really associate with much more than good companion, cheap beer and monotonous menu (Wiener Schnitzel; Wiener Schnitzel mit Pommes; Wiener Schnitzel mit Kartoffeln und Gemüsesalat; Pommes mit Pommes; Pommessalat mit Pizza und Cola). Just because drinking alcohol was so strictly prohibited for such youngsters as we, I felt constrained to drink as much as possible every day, even if the beer was so terrible and cheap (Zillertaler Wei&szlig;bier; Paulaner Wei&szlig;bier; Erdinger Wei&szlig;bier mit Pommes, Kartoffelsalat und Wiener Schnitzel).
  Coming back to the lonely teenage girl.
  'Where is the admirer, which used to help you walk your dog?'
  'He has died because of the excessive amount of love to me,' she said. (Actually, she didn't, but the true reason for his absence doesn't really play any major role in the plot, which is also missing).
  'Could I help you with your lovely dog (and it's even prettier mistress) on a more regular basis, then?'
  'No, I don't think so.'
  A few lines later she told me that her dog's eyes were as pretty and dark as hers, so I looked in her eyes, only to realize they were big and dark enough to outshine the Sun and a few other objects. Why must there be so many pretty chicks around? It's just as monotonous as the choice of beer in Austria!

  There once was a careless professor who was terribly busy with his everyday work and loved reading books in his spare time. His wife was very displeased with it, so one day she said to him:
  'It would be great if I became one of your books.'
  The professor felt very strange about this, so he asked her why.
  'This way I could spend time with you.'
  Professor's face turned red of embarassment and quickly said:
  'No, no, this is impossible. You know that after I finish reading a book I always take another one.'
  When his wife heard it, she replied sadly:
  'Then I will become the big dictionary, lying on your desk.'
  (A Course in Contemporary Chinese, Reading and Writing, lesson 89)

  I have heard that beginning one's lectures and articles with good jokes is generally considered a sign of good sense of humor and good taste. It's not that I am trying to make anybody believe in my good taste, and this joke isn't in fact really funny. But it's often quite nice to tell jokes which are not more dirty than all the world's homeless and Redtube combined. And it's a nice addition to this post's main point, which is another essay that I have written for my dearest English teacher, (not because I care about doing homeworks at all, I just like having fun of other people, lolz). I couldn't quite remember the subject she has given to me, so I thought out a new one. Hope you like it.

  '''Essay. Should children in general like going to school? Why? Why not?'''

  <em>In most countries in the world school is now compulsory. This results in ceaseless discussions between the students themselves, teachers and governments. Should children like going to school? In my essay I'll try to explain my own point of view for this subject.</em>
  <em>There is no doubt that some elementary things taught at school are really useful or necessary in our everyday life. These include, among others, the ability to communicate effectively with the outer world through reading and writing, counting money and knowing the way children are born. The rest is mostly rubbish, although we still need it to be respected in modern societies. No wonder most kids hate learning, just as they don't really treasure garbage.</em>
  <em>However, contrary to the common belief, there are also some good reasons for liking it. Firstly, at school one can meet trillions of interesting people which share our slavish destiny. Secondly, it is often a good way to spend some time when no good parties are organised in our town, and in winter, when it's just too cold to spend time outdoors.</em>
  <em>I am deeply convinced we should try to learn as much as possible, as </em>with understanding comes liberation<em>. Even so, I think that a healthy dose of hatred for school and one's teachers is needed to protect one from most mental diseased caused by going to school.</em>

  There is a chance I will finally go to China when I get myself a passport.

  Now that I've been back home for over a week, I guess that my vacations should have better not started. Okay, I'm flying to Beijing in August, for almost three weeks, but until then I am grounded here in Koszalin, and have to go ''busking'' every day to earn money for the whole trip. That's how it looks like in theory. In fact, I was caught into daily routine again. I get up at some point of the day, then I have to play the trumpet, do a bit of sport in order to prevent getting fat, offer some ''mandalas'', then I either go ''busking'' or not.

  Now, for those who don't know yet, the term ''busking'' means performing some sort of art, e.g. playing a musical instrument, painting, dancing, acting, reciting poetry or being a ''living statue'' in pedestrian areas, like old towns in popular and fashionable cities, in order to get donations from wealthy, drunk people passing by. Of course, almost no buskers like the ''living statues'', as they don't really have to do anything, save standing still in fancy clothing, and they usually earn way more money than those who needed years of practising on the trumpet, as I do. I used to like that job, because it's way more interesting than sitting somewhere reading books for 8 hours a day.

  OK, I didn't go busking today. The weather forecast for Koszalin claimed it would start to rain around half past seven, which would be like the time I usually start playing. So I've said to my mother this morning:
  "Well, I'm not sure if I'm going there today, for it's supposed to be pouring with rain at half past seven."
  "If so, do it the way it starts raining ''after'' you've finished playing," she replied.
  And then, when a few drops of water fell on my head, I thought it would probably start to rain heavily in a few seconds. It's 22.38 and it still hasn't really rained. I have wasted an evening of playing. ''Scheiße Autobahn''.

  And in the evenings, after I have come back from work, I usually meet some friends (of those few remaining) and go for a beer or two, not because I want to party, but because I have nothing better to do at home. I wonder if it wouldn't be better if I had a boring, 8-hour job selling ice-cream or even frying fish.

  I've got a book in German to learn from. It's title is ''Keine Angst vorm Lieben. 49 erotische Abenteuer'' (''No fear of making love. 49 erotic adventures'') and I have learned quite a few funny words for genitals, but not really much useful, everyday vocabulary. 25 days left to Beijing.

  It's Gdańsk.
  I'm here to apply for a visa for the trip to Beijing, planned for August (7th-28th). I couldn't help but get here a day in advance and stay in the local Buddhist centre, which in fact is quite a good way to stay. It costs only 15 zł, and for that price one gets a roof over one's head, access to a shower, a nice kitchen and a lot of room for meditation.
  The only problem is that I still miss some young single student with huge boobs and own flat. It might be difficult to fall asleep in such circumstances, but it is definitely more pleasant.
  My dad's mantra "don't make me to a grangpa" is still following me.
  I finished the book ''The Foreigner'' (''Cudzoziemka'') on the train and I can proceed to reading Stieg Larsson's ''The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo''.

  When I was 13 or 14, I wanted to learn to play the accordion. I even joined an accordion band (whose name I'd better just not reveal), but eventually my accordion career wasn't very long. The only song I ever learned to play was a Polish folk song called ''My little quail ran away'' (Pol.: ''Uciekła mi przepióreczka''). The lyrics tell a touching story of a young boy whose quail ran away onto a field of millet. The boy wanted to chase her barefoot, but needed to ask his mother in advance whether he was allowed to catch the bird or not.

  Now there are a few similarities between my life and life of the boy whose quail ran away. Now the quail may be the allegory of money running away from my eyesight; it can also represent girls who run away as soon as they see my disgusting face and the degree of the development of my adispose tissue. The boy goes barefoot, the same as I used to do a few years ago. He has to ask his mother questions concerning his own quail, which means he is supressed by rules and stereotypes. An old Zen proverb says: ''True liberty means that someone tells you to put on a red shirt and you put it on.''

  Missing one's career bus means choosing a wrong path. I've been pretending to play the trumpet for seven years now and the only reason why I haven't given it up yet is because it's kind of not cool to give up playing just a year before graduation. Even so, there still are some people who say I play my trumpet well and that I've got some musical talent. Well, I know a couple of folks in my school who practise way more, do it way better, who haven't lost the rest of their interest in music decades ago in favour of Diamond Way Buddhism and full shaped chicks with nice personalities. Many of the mentioned trumpeters are a few years younger. Are there really so many born virtuosos in Koszalin? Or should I consider it an undeniable proof that I'm in no way the best?
  And the talent? I don't believe in talents. There are congenital predispositions, interests & hobbies, and a lot of time spent on it. There were times when I thought I would study I.T. and become a famous programmer or so. Then I thought it's kinda boring to sit somewhere, damage one's eyes and just wasting time one could use to learn Chinese. But before I gave up my interest in computers, I've learned quite a few computer tricks, like basic usages of Linux and its console, no-look typing in two keyboard layouts (QWERTY & Dvorak), and some knowledge about websites which enabled me to create the website you're reading. Does it mean that I have any computer talents? No, it only means that I spend a lot of time at computer and therefore cannot play football at all, nor swim. Am I talented?

  Should I eat Beijing roast duck in Beijing or better avoid consuming meat? 18 days to Beijing.

  Home in Koszalin, then Gdańsk and back home in one day. A bit too exhausted too write, but I think I can do it.

  What made me so exhausted, then?
  It could probably be the yesterday night's party at Plastelina club. There were four of us: Sochal, my brother, Maurycy, with whom I'm going to Beijing, and I. Although we came together, we split after a while. I went on with my usual club activities, that is: consuming alcohol for other people's money, talking to some chicks and trying to get into some closer bodily contact without succeeding. Around 3 o'clock in the evening, a friend of mine, Żebro (Polish for a rib), said that she was going back home in the same direction. We went out of the club.

  And then she did it. She took off her shoes and we walked all the way through the town barefoot. I accompanied her all the way to her home and came back home alone. I went to sleep after four, after having consumed all the rests of Maurycy's pasta with bacon, cheese and eggs (a loose interpretation of ''spaghetti alla carbonara'', a popular Italian dish) and chatting a while on my mobile phone, using the great Symbian version of Facebook Chat. Getting up at 8.30 has never been that hard. Or maybe it has.

  I wanted to buy myself a coffee or something similar in Słupsk, but in the railway station there was a nice second-hand bookshop. I ended up with a 12 zł ''Rick Steves' Europe Through the Back Door 1996'' guide, full of profound wisdom and travel tips. This guy went on a two month trip around Europe with three shirts and a T-shirt. Anyway, I can't really try ''all'' those packing tips because my mother demands me to take a huge purple plane bag with wheels. Many other tips sound reasonable.

  I got my Chinese visa. 16 days to Beijing.

  It's Koszalin again.

  I could have probably written something earlier, e.g. when I came back home after having spent 18 days in China, when I turned 18 on 14th September, or when the school started. It could have become quite a long post, though. And looking back into the past shows clearly that writing ''a lot'' doesn't always mean having more to say. And my English teacher keeps saying that unless I learn to limit my works to matura standards, my matura works won't even be checked in the real exam. So, why don't I try to write all I want to say in 200-250 words?

  Thus, the beginning of the story is coming back from China. I spent 18 days in Beijing, Shanghai and Nanjing, together with the godson of my mother, and you can see most of the pictures on my Facebook profile.

  Then I went to school. One of my main activities now is trying to take sweet pictures with pretty chicks. I got myself one with Wang Xin, but the picture is still in China; one with Grażyna Torbicka and one with Kasia from the class <span style="font-variant: small-caps;">2m</span>.

  Lastly, I'm 18 now and I can do most of the things I would have never dreamed of before. But I don't. I'm just sitting in the kitchen, sipping from a bottle of wheat beer. Beer is beautiful.

  Ok, I admit that I haven't written anything for quite a long time. I simply had nothing to say. Okay, but now I would like to tell you something about ''books''.

  You see, recently I've been reading quite a lot of them. In fact, some people were feeling disgusted by that fact and asked me how many books I actually do read a day. It's not really that extreme (although I would really like to possess the ability to read photographically, seems quite useful for school), but I tried to count them. So, in the period from 1st Oct. till today (24th Oct.) I have read the following books: <ul><li>''Heart of Darkness'' by Joseph Conrad,</li><li>''In the Shade of Gods'' by Sidney Sheldon,</li><li>half of ''Thus Spoke Zarathustra'' by Nietzsche, too difficult for me,</li><li>''In Cold Blood'' by Truman Capote,</li><li>one radio drama by Friedrich Dürrenmatt (''Der Doppelgänger''),</li><li>and finally, ''Grobowiec Wielkiego Szamana'' (''Tomb of The Great Shaman'') by Sławomir Sierecki, (Wydawnictwo Morskie, Gdynia 1968).</li></ul> You may consider this list boring and just stop reading this post, but if you have nothing against it, I'll say something about the latter.

  The book is a fictional story of a Polish journalist who went to Mongolia to gather materials for his novel about the life of Genghis Khan. There is nothing wrong with the story itself, I was just wondering: why do almost all the characters speak either fluent literary English or Russian? I know that it is generally more common for people travelling all around the world to speak some foreign languages, but it is very hard for me to believe that the Mongolians, even in Ulan Bator, which was still the middle of nowhere back in '68, when the book was written, could speak either Russian or English on such a level&hellip; okay, maybe that's not really that impossible. But in every realistic novel, simple people speak simple language.

  But there was another example. A few decades ago, there was a popular Polish book series about ''Pan Samochodzik'', an office worker solving difficult criminal problems in a great style. And all of his co-workers could speak fluent English, German and Russian, isn't it weird? I mean, even nowadays, when we can learn almost every single language we want, when I want to tell someone a German joke and want them to understand it, I have to find either a German or someone after the German studies. Hopefully what I told about was just the fault of the censors.

  Okay, and I want to tell you what changed around in a clear, understandable way.
  The guinea-fowl is still shiny and beautiful, but the rooster realised she just wasn't worth it so he gave up.
  The cow became a doe and all the deer at the rut are growling.
  The dove came with an olive branch and announced the closeness of dry land, but it turned out it was made of plastic.
  I met my English teacher in the corridor and I told her bad morning, she said that she didn't like me either.

  I took part in the Autumn Spelling Competition today. The event was organized by my school and took place in our school's gym, as usual. The second stage, which only the best ten people to write the dictation could enter, consisted of two parts: a short test, checking one's ability to read IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), and spelling, which means that a native speaker (here an 18 y.o. American girl from the student exchange) reads aloud ten words and one has to spell them in English.

  For example, she is holding a piece of paper and says a word like HANDKERCHIEF twice. Now all those poor folks who did very well in the dictation (a passage from ''The Loneliness on the Net'' by Janusz L. Wiśniewski containing ridiculous words like ''sarcophagi'' or ''a bottle of cold Chardonnay'',) try to say ''H-A-N-D-K-E-R-C-H-I-E-F'' or ''M-O-T-H-E-R-[a gesture representing a hyphen]-I-N-[a gesture representing a hyphen]-L-A-W'' as properly as they can.

  We were listening. We &mdash; I mean, two people I already know; Ala, a nice first-grader and I. We were pretending to be stressed at first, but when I realized that I keep mixing up letters, I became really wild.

  I didn’t win. Some second-grader, some almost-American, did. Anyway, we all got those nice Empik gift vouchers &mdash; meaning a nice sum of money for books, in my case. I gave two of them to two of my classmates, 50&nbsp;zł each, and I bought ''The Good Soldier Švejk'', the book with DVD. My mother was so angry when she heard it! Can't she understand the law of cause and effect? Doesn’t she know how beneficial generosity is? She often says, ''if you want to be generous, do it with your own money''. Yo, wasn’t it my money?

  And there were free cakes and cookies and coffee. Ala, that first-grader, said that the cake was her mother's. I'll become so freaking ugly and fat again if I keep eating that stuff! And one of those girls in charge of cookies was so wildly pretty, and she's from Ala's class. I'll have to get her number, or something.

  The Idol came to Koszalin. Everyone was cheering. Chicks were deifying his unearthly beauty. All the music fans dressed up and went to his concert. I didn't. I'd rather sit in the library and write, if you ask.

content: "On Saturday, 14th Jan., 2012 I woke up late and feeling a bit dizzy. I had
  a nasty headache which meant I must have been drinking the night before. Had I?
  Oh really? And why? The following post is a brief explanation of how it happened.
  Well, in fact it isn't, but I haven't written for such a long time that nothing
  really matters.\n\nWe're living in horrible times, you know? I'm constantly feeling
  some undefined anxiety. I keep dreaming of things I don't have or don't deserve
  to have, and even if I get them, I'm still not happy. Sometimes I wake up in the
  middle of the night just to realize I'll never be perfectly happy. Around New Year,
  maybe a week or so earlier, I decided to develop a certain attitude towards a little
  blonde, a year younger, named Kasia (some of the more loyal readers have even met
  her in person). There was nothing wrong about it, but the feeling began to fade
  out slowly, and I ended up being a kind of cold bitch again. In the meantime I got
  so much inspired that I wrote a poem called [[Kiedy byłem bytem astralnym]] (English:
  [[When I was an astral body]]) and a few pages of an unfinished short story under
  a code name <a href=\"http://elefanto.cba.pl/chomiczowka.pdf\">Chomiczówka</a>.\n\nWriting
  a poem may turn out to be such a lot of fun, you know. I couldn't sleep at night
  again (it's happening more and more often lately) and I knew I had to write a poem
  which I could call ''When I was an astral body''. The result goes here: [[Kiedy
  byłem bytem astralnym]] or [[When I was an astral body]].\n\nAnd now I have a holiday
  which will last two weeks. That is connected to an interesting phenomenon which
  I noticed lately. For example, yesterday I got up at 7.30, which is amazing on holiday.
  I managed to go to German lesson, have lunch, meditate for half and hour, then go
  to music school and in the end it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon. What happened
  to all that time I was supposed to possess? Has anyone else noticed anything similar?
  Is there an astral body stealing the time I save or what? I mean, it's not really
  a pleasant feeling to run out of time, is it?\n\nAnd just one last thing. I searched
  for my name (Karol, in case you forgot) in the <a href=\"http://www.urbandictionary.com/\">Urban
  Dictionary</a> and the result was:\n\t\nThe cutest girl with the deepest eyes. It's
  said that if you look into a Karol's eyes for longer than just a few seconds, a
  trance will be set upon you, and you will be infatuated with her for approximately
  one lifetime. She also has the cutest smile and the greatest walk, which are almost
  as lovely as her voice (the greatest voice in the world).\nGuy1- \"Hey... You've
  been smiling for over a week now... What's up?\" \nGuy2- \"...Karol said 'Hi' to
  me... :)\"\n\nThat's the cutest interpretation of my name I have ever seen, even
  though I'm not a girl, really!\n"

  Oh this post is just to check whether it's possible to do it on Android. Looks like it is. I'm afraid that getting such a powerful toy which I can carry all along might mean the end to my productivity, which was not so gorgeous anyway. I have already downloaded a couple dozen interesting applications, including a Gameboy Advance emulator, Google's My Tracks and something for the e-books. Though I'm not sure if I'll still have any interest in books when I can finally play Pokemon on my mobile... Lol, and a friend of mine bought some Chinese tablet with Android for around a hundred bucks, and he uses it with a mouse because its screen is so terrible.

  I woke up with my head aching again. But now I'm perfectly sure that I wasn't drinking the night before. It just doesn't seem right you know. Oh come on, I know that the times when I was in junior high school were not exactly perfect, but I'm sure there was a time when I could get up at 6.35 every day and not be in agony two hours later. But do I really want those times to come back?

  In the "Language Hacking Guide", which I found almost accidentaly, it is strongly recommended to keep track of one's gradual advance in a "language learning log". It is also said that a blog which some people read or comment all the time is a great motivation to keep on learning.

  So right now I'm quite sure that after all the school mess I have to be facing until middle of May, I am still going to be learning some interesting foreign languages, and I will probably need your support to stay diligent. So, if there is someone who's still reading my blog and wants me to continue trying to achieve my silly goals, please raise your hands. Raised? Okay, now if you could '''please''' leave a comment under this post or any other, it would be really kind of you. I don't care what language it's written in as long as you don't insult me in a way I could understand.

  I also have to warn you that any comment without a signature would be lost forever. Thanks for everything and bye!

content: "It's Sunday, 19th February. A long time has passed since I last visited
  this place, but hardly anything has changed. I am still a high school student and
  I'm trying to enjoy the last months as much as possible. Last Tuesday was probably
  the very last opportunity for me to send a valentine. Valentine's Day is the most
  important time of year for people in relationships, epileptics as well as gift and
  flower shops. Everybody in my school was more than welcome to get a ready-made card
  for just a quid, fill it in and forget everything with a feeling of having done
  their duties with little effort. \n\nWe shall leave this way to the sycophants and
  to those who care about love. What I did was to buy a purple-coloured piece of cardboard
  and glued dozens of colourful clippings from a few magazines available (Italian
  ''Playboy'' and Polish ''Twój Weekend'', for instance) almost randomly, except for
  the address and the message (''someone loves you I wonder who lol'') inside. The
  card (<a href=\"/posts/Valentine for Little Kasia\">view it</a>) was somehow delivered
  and the recipient (in that case, little Kasia from the class <span style=\"font-variant:
  small-caps\">1m</span>) could somehow figure out who the author was, even though
  it wasn't signed. And well, I spent three hours thinking, cutting and gluing and
  got only a brief &ldquo;thank you&rdquo; in return. Come on.\n\nThe weather is far
  from perfection. All the snow that was lying around is melting, which on the one
  hand is nice, because  it meams that the air temperature is back above zero, but
  on the other hand it is impossible to walk some paths now, I mean, without a boat.
  The streets of my beloved town are deserted. Many people refrain from going anywhere
  in relatively unpleasant conditions. Some prefer using public transportation rather
  than the muscle-powered means of transport.\n\nWe shall leave this way to the sycophants
  and those patient enough not to lose their minds on the Polish roads. Even if there
  is a single person in the Universe who would still deny the fact that the bicycle
  is, at least in some conditions, the best means of transport, they most probably
  know that they're wrong anyway.\n\nMy P.E. teacher keeps criticising my general
  laziness in his classes, which might probably have something to do with the fact
  that I don't give a damn about the silly team games that we're forced to play. He
  says that I don't respect the fact that I've got a healthy body, while the disabled
  do all sorts of sports in spite of the numerous hindrances.\n\nWe shall leave this
  way to those who don't know about the impermanence of all things. I'd rather have
  fun my own way than play football with people who are not in posession of transcendental
  wisdom.\n \n"

  bump into old friends. It looks like I shouldn't spend so much time at home.\n"

  For some reason I suddenly remembered a certain morning in March of the previous year, when I woke up suddenly after a dream. I dreamt of holding a certain girl from the class \textsc{1m} &mdash; now \textsc{2m}, with which I was madly in love at that time. I remembered how disappointed I was upon waking up. And yet&hellip; the sun outside was shining so beautifully. Why didn't I notice it?

  A party was organised at my place last Saturday. No, I didn't do it. I just told a group of pals that my mother was going to be on duty, and they called and invited themselves. I was quite glad to be relieved of having to leave the house. I even managed to meet two charming young ladies at the party, although the word &ldquo;get to know&rdquo; might be a bit more appropriate. With it I mean the fact that I already knew both: the first one I already knew by sight, which isn't really odd if we've been going to the same school for the past two and a half years; the other one I met almost eight years ago and haven't had much contact with ever since, so the acquaintance sort of&hellip; expired. We were all drinking pretty badly, but I hope we could have another party (hopefully with a few more girls) in the closest future.

  My new mission: to achieve fluency in both written and spoken English. I might need that in case something goes wrong with my education.

  Yesterday was the hottest day in this year as far, and Friday. Unfortunately, I had so many classes that I only broke free around five o'clock. I definitely like spring. All day long I felt as if it were June and was terribly disappointed that it weren't holidays yet. I kept seeing a picture of myself dressed in light clothing and drinking very cold beer in a sunny garden of Eden.

  I managed to go out in the evening.

  Today I had a really nasty argument with my mother about eating cheese. It's been the same one all the time for 9 years now. Then a Jehova's Witness knock, knocked on my door to invite me to the Last Supper. This must mean I'm eating my Last Breakfast right now. Goodbye, then. I won't miss you.

  Now I know that spring has definitely started. Not only have the temperatures reached as much as 15 degrees, but also the enthusiasm, with which my friends and I go out on weekends have raised a lot. And they breed like mad! When I'm with them I feel as if it were the famous Woodstock festival and Jimi Hendrix were just about to play. The other Moroz is madly in love. And although a year ago the drinking group consisted of a few frustrated guys, a few girls have spontaneously joined us. Some of them are even quite beautiful.

  I'm the only one that's not madly in love in anyone at the moment. One of the only two of us.

  Today's post is about being late. For instance, I have developed a terrible habit of being constantly late for school. It has never been so bad before I went to Broniewski High School. During the first term in my first grade, I managed to only be late two or three times at all. But I also noticed very quickly that no one cared if I was late or not, even if my delay was very long. So in the other term there were already weeks when I was late eight times.

  I don't think anyone has ever given me a good reason to avoid being late. Every day when I'm leaving for school, it looks like all the external conditions were plotting against me. Firstly, I have to put on my socks and shoes, unless it's summer and I only put sandals or &mdash; in the past &mdash; no shoes at all. Then I still have to pack all the most necessary items. The list's contents vary on time of the year, but almost always include a few constant positions, like a good book to read, a working pen or pencil and my notebook. I think most of you know that I wanted to become a writer all the time since my early childhood, but it took me many years to realize how essential carrying a notebook is. During periods of intensive work on my last sixteen novels, I used to carry my Olivetti&nbsp;84 typewriter and a ream of paper, while in summer I put my skateboard in my backpack when I'm not using it at the moment. When the n-th repetition of the whole packing procedure is over, it often turns out that I need a drink. As a result, when I arrive at school, it often turns out that the lessons ended long ago and I could as well never have come. But I always ''do'' go out. There are several reasons for that. One is that I am accustomed to going to school and I would have nothing interesting to do at home, anyway. Another one is that my mother tells me to do so, although she isn't really a good example herself, as she is always at least half an hour late for work. Recently I heard her say on the phone in the morning: 'I'm terribly sorry, but I can't talk to you at the moment, because I need to hurry to work.' It really sounded like a joke, just like when my brother went to a party once and had to promise he would not drink alcohol.

  And there is another joke (read on the ''Suche Żarty'' group on Facebook):
  <em>'You know, Natasha, my failproof spy watch indicates you have no panties on you.'
  'Your failproof watch is wrong, Bond.'
  'Oh, sorry. Looks like it's half an hour fast.'</em>
  I took my genuine Rolex watch to school to use it as a prop for the joke. The watch itself has a long history. I bought it in Beijing Earth Park for 30 RMB and it ceased to work after a few days. A friend of mine suggested that I could go to a watchmaker and have it adjusted and the battery changed for around 20 Zloty, and it would be working nice then. The problem was that it would be more than I originally paid for it.

  I didn't have many opportunities to tell the joke, because I have only had a lesson and a half, but I had a lot of time to write instead. I went to ''Komisja Wojskowa'' (does anyone know the proper word for that?), only to find out that I am ''fit as a fiddle'' &mdash; that is an idiom that have never used before and that I had to check. I would say I'm ''zdrów jak ryba'' &mdash; ''healthy as a fish'' in Polish. I didn't know what to tell them when they asked me about my interests, so I only told them I like languages.

  I need to write more in Chinese by hand. I know the words but I keep forgetting what the characters are. For instance, I checked 耽误 four times but I keep forgetting it. I will have to know more characters if I'm going to be a good translator.

  I would probably write something more, but the events of the last evening, combined with past week's lack of sleep, made me not get up before 10.47 AM. I know that for many of you can't see anything wrong about it, but I belong to that part of society which hates to waste the day on sleeping. The proportions range between around 34:28 in most European societies to 50:10 in Latin America, according to a completely made up statistics. But that was not the point.

  I would like to tell you the last evening's story. It's not going to be interesting or unusual. There are simply very few events in my life that a true adventure seeker would find exciting, so if you fall asleep while reading, please don't bother expressing it in the comments below. But something weird started when I first read a ["blog post":http://toniezabawa.blog.pl/dziewietnasty-marca,15631950,n] by my father's cousin:

  bq. "Crucial for all that is the fact that the natural environment that I need for writing the blog, is back available. In a correctly parked car, with a laptop equipped with a new battery, with the sun hanging still quite high above the horizon, with a door window slid down, and no crackling cold behind it, but a quite pleasant wind at the temperature of around ten degrees Celsius, consuming amber liquid, thus I'm writing."

  I was obsessed. Consuming amber liquid in a parked car? On a pleasant spring evening? The thought seemed like ["Paradise":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G4isv_Fylg] to me. But there were still a few problems to solve:
  * if you drink and drive, you can easily lose your driving license,
  * but I had no driving license to lose,
  * and no car.

  Then, on a Friday evening of 23rd of March, a Beautiful Young Lady (whose name begins with the letter M) sent me a text message saying that she could get me somewhere with her car. Around ten o'clock I was taken with a red Peugeot&nbsp;206, along with another Beautiful Young Lady (whose name begins with the letter I,) to a shop, where I was bought a large supply of amber liquid, and then we went to Jamno to the ferry harbour. And I Did It! In a parked car!

  I didn't write a blog post, though. As most of you know, writing a truly good blog post is by no means easy. The truest stories are always written by life itself. I doubt if I'll ever get near that point in my writing.

  I woke up early in the morning, and only to find out that there was nothing to eat at home. I only had enough time to either go get some bread, or to eat what was left--that is, not really much. Both options required pretending that I can live without Cheese and fresh Tomatoes. But what's the point of getting up if you have no Cheese or Tomatoes?

  But nothing has ever been really logical in my world, so I got up and went to school all the same. I managed to only be late 25 minutes for the first lesson, Polish. We were talking about Romantic Dramas. I used to like this topic. Maybe because my life was always a Romantic Drama. There have been unhappy karmic relationships, political __Kogel Mogel__ and paranormal influences. It was mysterious and gloomy, and Marta says that she had always had eternal __Weltschmerz__. And yet I'm not complaining. I was told about yet another poetry competition and I consider giving them my best love poem so far (and with hints of autoeroticism), "Dla Oli L":/posts/48. But who would print an autoerotical poem in a school magazine? And what's the point of giving away love poems if it is definitely not going to be printed anyway?

  At least it looks like I'm going to Vienna for Easter. I will have to spend 12 hours in the car, but Books are known to be Read during Long Journeys, and I heard that reading Books is Beneficial. Then, I will have a lot of opportunities to visit Important Historical Places, but I'm not even sure if I manage to rent a bicycle and go to the University of Vienna to inquire about my potential studies. All that I've read on the Web was a bit too beautiful to be true. I might manage to the Buddhist Meditation Centre and meet a few local Buddhists. Then, I'll definitely manage to have a few Decent Talks in Austrian and meet many Interesting People. I will bring a few beers home to give them to some better friends. And the best part is that I'm *not* going with any member of my family. Well, and what's the point of going anywhere if a Stubborn Mother keeps telling you to come back home before 11 or... or... well, most Stubborn Mothers are known to claim that they always know better.

  But all the same, what's the point? WHAT'S THE POINT of Life, Universe and Everything?!

  Ciao, Bella. I keep Walking, because Walking calms me down.

  I need to complain that I was Told Off today by my German teacher. She said that others complained that my attitude to the preparations for the German Language Olympics was terribly nonchalant, and that I was showing off with how little I learn. Some people have even suggested that my going to Poznan for the final may have no sense. Oh, yeah, and I think saying so isn't just Groundless Bullshit. Everyone knows that there were loads of students in Broniewski High School who ever managed to get through to the final; that dozens of them are sighted every single day. There are definitely going to only be more and more, now that we finally have our two single periods a week, filled with joyous laughter, innovative learning techniques and that every single kid explodes with enthusiasm at the sole thought of being allowed to finally learn vocabulary by heart and adjust to matura exam standards. Yeah, totally.

  I am not going to indicate precisely whom I suspect of having said so, but this person may be one of the teacher staff's numerous Venerable Old Men. I poo on you, Polish Education System, in which no one matter's if they're not a bishop's child. I don't care what the teachers are going to do to me if they find out that I'm not "respecting their authority":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIVHNylH1Mk.

  Frankly speaking, I had to force myself to write all that. It isn't easy to still be angry after a meditation session, even if it's quite short. But I just thought those words had to be written down. You don't have to be weird to think that Poland is governed by idiots. You're not a betrayer if you want to break free. I'm leaving. I'm leaving as soon as I pass my matura exam or not. I promise.

  Название этой статьи совсем не связанное ни з ком. Это просто предложение, которое я сегодня увидел на стене, когда я шел на бассейн. На стенах и оградах в целой Польше (и, наверное, в целом мире) вобще пишат очень много умных предложений. На пример, в Гданьске, где сейчас живет мой брат и несколько других классных людей, в подземным переходе (тих есть в Гданьске невероятно много), я однажды увидел такой текст: „Друзья как будто тихие ангелы, которые подносят наши крылья, когда они забыли, как летать”.

  В некоторых городах предложения, написанные на стенах почти как сокровищницы древней мудрости. Этак в начале апреля я поехал в Вену. Уже раньше ведомо было, что я планирую переехать в Вену, но когда я в первый раз увидел этот город, я сразу решил переехать туда на всегда. Или хотя бы на пять лет. Нетрудно понять, почему Вена нравится мне лучше чем Кошалин. Во-первых, улицы и дома весде где я был были очень красивые и хорошо поддерживаные. Во-вторых, в Австрии можна заработывать много денег. Если найти хорошую работу -- чрезвычайно много денег. Во-третих, там есть невероятно много иностранцев, которые говорят на всех языках мира, в том числе по-русски, по-китайски, по-чешски и по-итальянски. Временами можна найти австрейцев, которые умеют так хорошо говорить по-немецки чтобы все их поняли, а однажды в Вене я ехал на трамвае возле семьи, в которой все члены говорили и по-немецки, и по-русски. Только поляков я много не встретил. Они, наверное, все вернулись домой на Пасху.

  The title of this post has nothing whatsoever to do with anyone. It is just a sentence that I saw written on the wall when I was going to the swimming pool. There are lots of wise sentences written on the walls in Poland (and probably in the whole world. For instance, in Gdańsk, where my brother and some other cool people live, in a subway (there are incredlibly many of them in Gdańsk,) I once saw such one: "Friends are like silent angels who lift our wings when they forgot how to fly."

  In some cities, the sentences written on the walls could even be thought of as treasures of ancient wisdom. Around the beginning of April I went to Vienna. It was long before known that I want to move to Vienna, but when I saw the place for the first time, I immediately decided to move there forever. Or at least for five years. It's not hard to understand why I like that city more than I like Koszalin. Firstly, the streets and houses in the places where I've been were all pretty and well maintained. Secondly, in Austria one can earn a lot of money. If one finds a good job--incredibly much money. Thirdly, there are bunches of foreigners there, speaking all the languages of the world, including Russian, Czech and Italian. Sometimes you can find Austrians who could speak German well enough to make it possible for everyone to understand, and once in Vienna I was sitting on the tram near a family whose members spoke both German and Russian alternately. I haven't seen many Poles, though. They must have come back to Poland for Easter.

  It's Szczecinek. I probably won't be staying here for too long, as it is just a stop on my way to Warsaw today. I wanted to write this post for a week or so already, but I was so busy with leaving Koszalin that I couldn't just sit and type it. And as you know, once you open Facebook, you cease to be creative anyway. I have finished high school and sat all of my matura exams, which means I can leave for good. Well again, even though there were times when no one wanted to meet me, I have met so many interesting people in Koszalin that I spent a huge part of my last weekend in Koszalin just saying goodbye to them and some of them kept telling me not to leave. But I left for Vienna and here I am, on the bus to Warsaw, sitting with my laptop on my lap (now you know why it's called so,) and I shall arrive in Warsaw Central at 8.55 p.m., which leaves me quite a lot of spare time to manage.

  I spent so much time thinking positively that I think now's the time to thinking of what can go *wrong*. Firstly, if I don't succeed in finding a shared apartment and end up with no place to live in Vienna, I will have no other choice than go back home. Then, if I end up with no job for the summer, there is little to no hope that I would be able to find a job for the academic year. Assuming that I passed my matura exam and my mother doesn't lose my school report before I get to the university. Then I don't necessarily have to like Vienna as a place to live, even though everyone I know says it's great and fascinating. I would go back. I'm sure going back to Koszalin after a longer absence like the one I'm planning would be nice, even if it involved another long journey like this one.

  Even if everything goes wrong: my holidays *really* started. A month and a half earlier than those of my second-grade colleagues, and lasting a month longer. I could go camping or find a nice job in Mielno. So why did I choose Vienna when 1€ costs nearly 4.40 PLN?

  To those who care about staying in touch with me: I will probably start to use Skype and I'll still be available through my current mobile number _and_ the previous T-Mobile number. Anyway, most of you are my Friends on Facebook and/or have my e-mail address. And I will be using German as my primary language, but my blog will still be in English. Cheers!

  *Edit:* It's somewhere in Bydgoszcz. I wanted to write that I will never go anywhere with a PKS bus, but I'm not so sure about it--''never say never,'' they say, meaning that you can't speak about very distant future because, as every Buddhist knows, time cannot possibly have a beginning or an end. I chose this option because when I checked the trains to Warsaw on the Net, it seemed as if there were no reasonable connections, and the bus is direct, goes _only_ 9 hours (even though a train needed 7 hours only a few years ago), and costs less. Yeah, the ticket itself might cost less, but keep in mind that you get the toilets for free on the train, while they *always* cost around 2.50 PLN at every bus station in Poland. So on longer trips the cost would be more or less the same, and you can choose to drink beer on the train without having to worry about your bladder--OK, the toilets on the train might not be the best in Europe, but they're getting better all the time and you can find water, soap and paper towels on virtually every train. In the bus I'm on there are two folks that chose to drink beer and stink sitting two rows behind me. And I can't sit with the computer on my lap as freely as I could on a train. I just know for sure that Polish transport sucks.

  I got a text message from my Polish teacher that I passed the spoken part of my matura exam in Polish, which means that if I did the essay right in the written part, I just passed my matura exam _and_ I can become a student. The thought of it is somehow not as much appealing to me as it was a year or so ago, but nothing in the world is really permanent--even a ''permanent marker'' can be removed easily with a few drops of denaturated alcohol, at least on most surfaces--so I will probably just have to accept it.

  I just realized how many times the word ''I'' has been used in the post. It's high time I finish this post.

  It's Koszalin. I was supposed to be settled in Vienna by now, but the whole thing got sucked up after a week abroad. I do not often have such difficulties with meeting new and interesting people. During my 18 days stay in the P.R.C. last summer I managed to meet quite a lot of fascinating young idealists, and a few of them were even pretty Chinese chicks. Yeah, but it was not the same in Austria. I am against most stereotypes (although I can't help agreeing with many others,) but I must admit that some Germans and Austrians are boring and stiff. I thought it might be not that bad, even though I have read quite a lot of discouraging stuff about Vienna on the Net (_o my gosh why is it such a depressive city_). On top of that, even if I could understand what all the Buddhists said to me, as they were speaking the common variant, i.e. __Hochdeutsch__, I was still helpless when trying to speak to simple people from the working class. Some Germans told me they couldn't understand the Austrian dialect, either.

  Today is Wednesday, 6th June, 2012, and that means I came back 11 days ago already--I'm not sure. Please forgive me my poor mathematic skills. I cannot count well, and I cannot count on my mother's money any more, as she told me she wouldn't pay for my living, now that I'm of age and have a lot of spare time, with which I do not do anything of use. In my opinion, the latter isn't quite true, because I am spending a vast amount of time every day on learning, meditation and exercising my earthly body at the swimming pool. And who would like to work for 6 zł an hour if the wage wouldn't even cover the additional expenses such as food and transport? Who would like to spend several hours every day in one place during each summer month? And last but not least, who would like to work at all if their mother got a new job in which she spends half of their time and insists on working in two more places, proving to be a workaholic? I think the history has already provided us with a sufficient number of examples of mad people, and I don't want to become one. It is enough that I believed everything would be easier once I graduate from high school.

  As some of you might have already noticed, today's post is the 150th. I celebrated the 50th and 100th, although I don't recall how I celebrated the 50th post and not much from the 100th, either (I mean, I only remembered something until midnight, not much afterwards.) Who wants to celebrate with me? No one? Okay, I knew that.

  If you are reading these words, there is a possibility that you ended up here after watching my "last Spanish video":http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_busRacLNfc&feature=youtu.be on YouTube. It has everything to do with my ongoing Spanish mission, that is, to get some Spanish during the summer. I don't really have a plan, but I was too lazy to think of one. This video presents me talking about Polish beer in the Tesco supermarket, in the Forum shopping centre. If you came here just to read something, you can watch it below (there will be subtitles available):

  \url{http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_busRacLNfc}

  There was also another video in which I was speaking Spanish in front of my laptop, but I was cheating then, because I was reading everything from the screen, and people have told me they had noticed that fact. This one was unrehearsed and only prepared in my mind, but as you can see, I forgot everything at the point I opened my mouth. I made some subtitles (maaan, was it tedious!!!) in Spanish and English. In Spanish you can notice most of my grammatical mistakes, and in English I wrote more or less what I meant.

  OK, I guess that was everything. If by some accident you're a Spanish native speaker, you can "contact":/posts/Contact me!

  And _Dear XYZ, it would be nice if you "contacted":/posts/Contact me, too. I'm afraid I won't attend any of the ceremonies you will take part in in the coming month, and since you don't have Facebook, we could lose contact forever. Just some number or e-mail address!_

content: "It's Somewhere. I've been trying to write something for the last month,
  but everything I could write would be too complicated and I would never finish the
  post. Thus, even though I would really love to produce a 10000-word-long one with
  short videos, just to make sure nobody will actually read the whole post, so that
  I could put a few strong insults directed at those with whom I was formerly acquainted
  somewhere in the last, I can't. I am limited by the small screen keyboard of my
  mobile.\n\nI spent nearly all the last week of June in Rostock, in northern Germany.
  It was really a nice time, but I have no intention whatsoever of writing much more.\n\nThen
  I went back home to prepare for this year's summer Buddhist course in Kuchary. The
  tough part was that I fell ill the day before leaving and I didn't have much more
  contact with reality while packing--I mean, I had even less contact with reality
  than usually.\n\nNow that I am writing these words I am in Kuchary and I'm pretty
  healthy, but I have to work for food this year. I am a member of the so-called service
  team, and my tasks consist of cleaning the lavatories, the showers and the washbasins.
  The job itself is not bad at all, but I have to get up at 6 every day, which is
  a bit hard when you go to sleep at 4 in the evening.\n\nEdit: On the train to Poznań.
  Here come the news: I have been approved as a student of Chinese studies at the
  Adam Mickiewicz University of Poznań. I didn't really have to go to the university
  in person as I could send everything by post, but I prefer it that way, because
  I already regret coming back from Kuchary. I met a young Slovak lady there that
  talked me into going to a Buddhist course in Slovakia. I feel that I just __have__
  to go there, I'm positive about it. The only problem I can encounter would be the
  money one. A friend of mine wanted me to translate her master thesis from Chinese
  into Polish for a satisfactory sum, but unfortunately I cannot get in touch with
  her now that I need her.\n\nI'm back in the non-Buddhist environment, but I never
  want to participate in samsara any more.\n \n"

  Ich möchte Euch eine Geschichte erzählen, aber ich kenne leider nur den Anfang. Also: ich war gestern auf der Hochzeit meines Freundes aus der Sangha. Während der Trauung habe ich schon das Mädchen, das die Eheringe reichte, bemerkt. Sie sah nicht schlecht aus. Ich fragte einen Menschen, wer das Mädchen war, und es erwies sich, dass es die Schwester des Bräutigams sei. Zwischen der Trauung und der Hochzeit gab es einige Zeit, in der die Familie des jungen Paares zu Mittag aß. Dann habe ich eine Nachricht an eine Kollegin geschickt:
  ''Mein Lama, gib mir die Willensstärke, damit ich mich nicht zu sehr besaufe und keine sehr dumme Sachen mache. Bis zur Grenze des Kotzens genügt. Und solche sehr dumme, denn normal dumme gehen schon wenn nüchtern. Es ist merkwürdig, dass ich in Kuchary nie Schwierigkeiten hatte, sich den Mädels vorzustellen, und in der Schule habe ich das in eineinhalb Jahr nicht geschafft.''

  Ich habe mich vorgestellt. Dann haben wir lange geredet. Ich habe ihr vielleicht die lustigste Geschichte dieses Lebens erzählt, die erklärt, warum ich Kung-Fu aufgegeben habe. Ich war nämlich einmal in Kuchary (vor 2 Jahren) und bin einem Mädchen begegnet, das mich von Anfang an am Arsch griff. Und dann habe ich mich schwer besoffen, denn es ist alles während der letzten Party passiert, und plötzlich hat mich dasselbe Mädchen auf den Boden fallen lassen, und ich glaube, dass sie sich auf mich setzen wollte. Zu jener Zeit habe ich noch Wing Tsun Kung-Fu getrieben, und mir blieb nichts Anderes übrig, als sie zu überwältigen und ihr den Ellbogen an den Hals zu legen. Offensichtlich war damit eigentlich keiner zufrieden. Die Kung-Fu treibenden Leute würden mir empfehlen, ich solle den Alkohol aufgeben, aber mir war viel bequemer (und günstiger), Kung-Fu aufzugeben. Das war also die Geschichte.

  Nach einiger Zeit wurde das Mädchen, mit dem ich mich unterhielt, plötzlich sehr schnell. Bilokation, d.h. die Fähigkeit, an zwei Orten in demselben Augenblick zu sein, ist mir nichts Neues. Der 16. Karmapa hat schließlich einmal dieselbe Initiation an drei Orten gegeben, oder so was. Aber das Mädchen hat offensichtlich Omnilokation beherrscht, denn sie war überall. Nie zuvor habe ich in diesem Leben so etwas gesehen. Danach ist sie verschwindet, und kurz später war die Party zu Ende. Mindestens für mich. Das Nächste, woran ich mich erinnere, war, dass mich jemand geweckt hatte und ich musste nach Hause. Es war kurz vor 6 Uhr. Und es war daran etwas Seltsames.

  Als ich jünger war, habe ich versucht, zwei Filme von Werner Herzog zu sehen. Die fand ich absolut unmöglich. Aber letztens hat mir mein Nachbar Chris den Film ''Stroszek'' gezeigt. Der erzählt die Geschichte eines Straßenmusikanten, der mit einer Prostituierten und seinem Nachbar nach Amerika fährt, um sein Glück zu finden, und findet... eigentlich nichts. Der Film endet mit einem tanzenden Hähnchen und ist zweifellos ein Meisterstück. Chris hat gesagt, der Sänger der Band ''Joy Division'' habe nach diesem Film Selbstmord begangen. Der nächste Film von Herzog, den ich nach ''Stroszek'' sah, war ''Jeder für sich und Gott gegen alle''. Am Ende des Filmes erzählt der Hauptheld, Kaspar Hauser, eine Geschichte. Er kennt aber leider nur den Anfang:

  It's Poznań.

  I like to start my posts with the name of a city because it usually means that some movement has occured. In that case--I went for the final of German Language Olympics with my teacher. I can't say it was a pleasant experience yet, because I had to go with the 6.30 train, and that meant getting up at 5.30. And although I was supposed to go alone at first, which would be quite all right with me, our school principal decided he couldn't let my teacher go on her own just to watch the competition. So I had to go with my teacher. Then he decided we shouldn't go with the car. As an argument for his thesis he claimed that there were superb train connections who cover the distance in just three hours, which is faster than with a car, and much cheaper. Of course, I was more than surprised to hear it, but I was too much of a coward to make sure we were talking about the same Poznań--and the same country. I can't wait till I pass my matura exam and I can say aloud what I think of some members of the teacher staff.

  The superb train departed at 6.30 in the morning, and I had to Be in Time. My maternal grandfather had always said that there were three variants of Being in Time: coming too early, coming too late and being Just in Time. With him you could never miss a train--you would usually come way too early and still be able to spend over an hour on the station doing nothing, as if it was the train that was late. This time I manage to be Just in Time. The carriage was nearly empty, but there was a drawback--the heating was off all the way. Not that I'm afraid of low temperatures when spending time actively, but after the second hour of lying underneath a jacket that could only cover half of my body, I started to freeze.

  But I'd rather stop complaining. Hopefully my roommates are nice and outgoing. I can't stand the whole weekend without someone outgoing. I'll write later.

content: "Rattle, rattle, rattling sound of those little wheels, and I got mastodontized.
  When they jump upon the slightest unevennesses of the ground, I regret having taken
  the suitcase rather than a backpack. Unfortunately, I had not much choice. It's
  still Poznań when I'm first writing these words but someplace else when I'm typing
  them on the train (\"third variant\":/posts/50). During the past two days I took
  part in the final of the 35th German Language Olympics. Maybe it's not the best
  possible translation for __Olimpiada Języka Niemieckiego__, as I heard someone using
  the word __Spiel__ when talking of the same event in German. If you want to read
  my remarks to the event itself, read on, otherwise you can skip a few paragraphs
  to some more interesting section.\n\nI can't state clearly whether the event was
  a pleasant experience or not. I certainly benefited a lot, speaking in both materialistic
  and mental terms. It is a great feeling to listen to some overly solemn words and
  be adressed \"sir\" constantly for two days, and there were also _some_ interesting
  people. Some could expect that everyone who makes his way to the final must learn
  a lot and thus be boring, and that girls who learn a lot are mostly ugly. Most Poles
  (and some Germans, too) claim that all the German women are disgustingly ugly. Luckily
  enough, it doesn't necessarily need to apply also to those who just speak the language.
  There were quite a few really good-lucking ones in the final. However, partly because
  of my slight degree of mastodontization, connected with the fact that my teacher
  made me spend a lot of time on formal occasions with her exclusively, and partly
  because not too many of them wanted to meet me, I only just met one or two (depending
  on whether I count the one that only punched me and said one word to me, lolz.)\n\nPrizes.
  Luckily, I didn't achieve any particular \n\nPartying. That's another point. For
  some reason it wasn't really too much fun there in Poznań. Everyone had a lot of
  money and we had virtually unlimited time, but on Saturday evening many people have
  gone to bed as early as half past midnight. Before I managed to went to sleep, I
  had to go through a part of an embarassingly boring party where everyone just talked
  to their own friends. A potentially great social game of \"never\" (say what you
  have never done and the other players who have done it have to drink drink) was
  constrained and monotonous. Some people asked me over and over again to tell my
  worst jokes, even though I only remembered a few that I've stolen from somewhere.
  No one laughed at them. There were no deep new friendships, no choral singing outdoors
  at four o'clock, but just a few moments of painful realization of what my cousin
  had once said about partying--that the most important factor for a good party is
  good companion, and the second most important is good music. Of course, no one enjoys
  spending too much time with people they can't stand. There is no use drinking excessive
  amounts of beer with the wrong people. There is a brilliant proverb in Polish that
  fits the situation best: __z gówna garnca nie ulepisz__ (you can't model a pot out
  of shit.)\n\nI could probably have suspected that bringing a computer connected
  to the Web to Poznań (where there is no Internet connection) would make my room
  a centre of the local social life. I had to take it to prepare the bibliography
  for my matura exam, but I only managed to write a few entries. However, as my presentation
  topic has something to do with blogging, I am going to read a few articles covering
  the said topic. It's really weird how much I can still learn about blogging even
  though I have written a blog myself for almost four years. For instance, I realized
  how much a blog has in common with a simple diary, even though they're essentially
  different in form. Most paper diaries written by teenagers of the past were about
  the same topics as the modern blogs. Żeromski, too, had written about girls and
  school in more or less the same way as we do it today.\n\nHow much earlier could
  blogs have been invented if everyone could write in the 14th century? And what if
  Leonardo da Vinci or Jesus Christ were bloggers? Would Christianity still get half
  of the medieval world under control or dissolve into nothingness if Saint Peter
  or Judas had their words saved forever by Google? What do you think?\n"
