    are as rare as interesting moments at school. The point is that on Monday, 3rd Jan.,
    that is the first Monday of the year, I was late for English. My teacher came to
    me, while I was discussing New Year's celebrations with my schoolmate, Marta, and
    ordered me to write an essay of 250 words."

    in the morning, while I was lazily walking back to school after a weekend. The Elephant
    is back! Some minutes past nine and I am in front of the classroom door, corridors
    empty, no one is home. Enter the Elephant! A few loud steps and sound of funfairs.
    I was wondering how to greet my fellow classmates in an unusual way."
