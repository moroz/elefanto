<p>Welcome to my website! My name is Karol Moroz. I am originally from Koszalin, Poland, but I tend to wander around the world, so the place of my residence is subject to changes. Right now (while writing these words) I live in Poznań, Poland, where I study Chinese Studies at the AMU. In a few months I am going to China for a year-long scholarship, and this blog is meant to be a means of communication with the outer (Western) world during my travels.</p>

<p>I've kept blogs before, one of them was called Ubogo, ale chędogo (Poor but cool, written in my native language–Polish) and I started that one very young, in 2008. Afterwards my logorrhea ended up on a website called Elefanto, written in English, but the CMS engine for that one was written in Ruby on Rails mostly by myself and it was hardly portable at all, so when my hosting service provider raised their fees from $0/month to $45/year, I couldn't help but close down. This blog not only looks like Wikipedia, it also uses the same CMS engine, called Mediawiki. I planned to write every post in Chinese now and then translate to English, but it doesn't seem very realistic, as I'm usually very lazy. On top of that, I often find myself at a loss even while translating my own words.</p>

<p>Not all of my past blog entries have been moved yet, if you want more, feel free to contact me.</p>
