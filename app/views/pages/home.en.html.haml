%p Welcome to my website! My name is Karol Moroz. I am originally from Koszalin, Poland, but I tend to wander around the world, so the place of my residence is subject to changes. I grew up in Koszalin, Poland. I spent three years in Pozna≈Ñ, Poland, nine months in Chengdu, Sichuan province, P.R.C. I am currently residing in Taipei, and every day when I wake up, I don't really know where I will end up that day.

%p I have several hobbies. For instance, when I was six, I could already read and write, albeit not very fluently, and it occurred to me that, perhaps, one day I will become a great writer. I am not so sure about that now, though. I like making friends, be it from Poland or pretty much anywhere else. I'm also profoundly interested in foreign languages. I have a B.A. in Chinese Studies and there is a possibility that I might also pursue a Master's degree when I go back to Europe. I speak Polish, English and Standard Chinese (a.k.a. Mandarin) and I've learned several other languages in my life. I'm a follower of Diamond Way Buddhism and I meditate.

%p On one beautiful May morning back in 2008, on the way to school, I decided to create a blog. For the next 8 years that was where I published my reflections on life, interpersonal relations and other random crap.
